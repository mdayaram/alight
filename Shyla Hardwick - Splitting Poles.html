  <p class="ProseStanza">Dark alleys and sticky shoe soles. Yelling at me to pick up my feet.<br>
    <em>I cant momma I cant walk anymore can you carry me?</em>
  </p>
  <p class="ProseStanza">She said I was too big to be picked up, so I made her drag me through the back alleys of Detroit until she gave in and bolstered me on her back. My pants, sticky with street slime and urine. My little body, attached to hers. Hers, slightly larger from years and tattered with evidence of once being something else. Her body&mdash;a worn police car turned into taxi with legs too fast to keep up without.</p>  
  <p class="ProseStanza">We walked for hours at a time stopping for donuts, corner store pizza slices (day old and wrapped in foil), and to piss in the bushes. Mama always kept tissue in her pockets and a stick tucked underneath her arm for defense.  She observed everything while folding Better Made potato chips bags until they became cigarette butts. She always held onto me as we crossed the street. Walking, I encountered my first taste of beer; I spit out my tongue in disgust. Walking, I puffed my first cigarette; I spent 20 minutes coughing my lungs out onto the sidewalk.</p>
  <p class="ProseStanza">We&rsquo;d walk from sunrise until it was dark again. Until the alleys began to chase us, getting longer with each step. Each rewound footprint became a destination. Searching for a place that made sense. Me, never really realizing that she was trying her best not to stay still. She wanted to hold onto my little body without dropping herself.</p>
  <p class="ProseStanza">I have never felt as loved as did back then. As she dragged me down Livernois and into bars where I had to wait in the lobby. She would argue with the doorman for my entry as I entertained myself, standing on phone books at phone booths, prank calling the operator.</p>
  <p class="ProseStanza">To this day when I think of home I don&rsquo;t think of a person or a place but the feeling of rubbery legs being dragged along broken pavement. Wondering why my ultra-superstitious mother would allow us to split poles like this. Laughing on the inside at myself, my tears, her curses, her frustration. Laughing internally. Because I  had a feeling she was doing the same.</p>
  <p class="ProseStanza">When I think of home. I think of the absence of stillness&mdash;moving. Legs itchy from urination. Fingers sticky from stolen lollipops. Wanting to be held. Picked up. Wishing that my mother would never let me go. Making her drag me as proof that she never would.</p>

    <div class="PoemStanza">
      <p class="PoemLine">In this photo, he is laughing.</p>
      <p class="PoemLine">There is no cotton gin tied around his waist.</p>
      <p class="PoemLine">He’s not stretched into swollen limbs. </p>
      <p class="PoemLine">His eyes are still hazel and recognizable.</p>
      <p class="PoemLine">Two neat white rows of perfect teeth sit</p>
      <p class="PoemLine">totem-like in his mouth, and the world </p>
      <p class="PoemLine">did not know him because he had not </p>
      <p class="PoemLine">been murdered yet.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="PoemStanza">
      <p class="PoemLine1">He’s still slipping into the kitchen </p>
      <p class="PoemLine">to get another piece of cornbread </p>
      <p class="PoemLine">while his mama ain’t  lookin’. </p>
      <p class="PoemLine">He will mash it with his fingers, drink </p>
      <p class="PoemLine">some buttermilk and smile with those eyes. </p>
      <p class="PoemLine">They are still hazel and bright, like stars </p>
      <p class="PoemLine">in uppercase, and ain’t nobody </p>
      <p class="PoemLine">gouged ‘em out or shut ‘em closed </p>
      <p class="PoemLine">and when he goes to school, </p>
      <p class="PoemLine">he’ll do a silly little dance with his arms </p>
      <p class="PoemLine">and legs cocked out at odd angles, </p>
      <p class="PoemLine">and his classmates will laugh and there will be </p>
      <p class="PoemLine">no cotton gin tied around his waist. </p>
    </div>
    <div class="PoemStanza">
      <p class="PoemLine1">In the next photo, he’s proud of the hat on his head. </p>
      <p class="PoemLine">You can see that by how straight his neck is.</p>
      <p class="PoemLine">His Mama is in the picture, and they got the same face </p>
      <p class="PoemLine">and his head is high and perfect and ain’t no bullet in it </p>
      <p class="PoemLine">and it will be months before there is one,</p>
      <p class="PoemLine">and in those months he’s still his mother’s child…</p>
      <p class="PoemLine">The smug and overfed manchild all Southern ladies </p>
      <p class="PoemLine">love to cook for, ‘cuz he licks the plate clean even </p>
      <p class="PoemLine">if there’s leftovers, he just eats and <em>Yes, ma’ams</em></p>
      <p class="PoemLine">and makes you giggle so much you gotta shoo him out</p>
      <p class="PoemLine">the kitchen so you can get the pots clean and he’s </p>
      <p class="PoemLine">breathing     and     whole     and</p>
      <p class="PoemLine">ain’t no men dressed like midnight with sunless, un-laughing eyes</p>
      <p class="PoemLine">snatching him out the door, changing everything when neither </p>
      <p class="PoemLine">he nor his mother asked to be anything other than </p>
      <p class="PoemLine">laughing in the kitchen with the greens still simmering in the pot. </p>
    </div>
    <div class="PoemStanza">
      <p class="PoemLine1">The last photo of Emmett Till is a holocaust. </p>
      <p class="PoemLine">The picture that history concretized into the nighttime musings</p>
      <p class="PoemLine">of black children who hop-scotched above and below Bible Belt,</p>
      <p class="PoemLine">who saw a tattered, otherworldly version of the fourteen year old </p>
      <p class="PoemLine">Till, head poised strangely above a sharp black suit on the cover </p>
      <p class="PoemLine">of <em>Jet</em> magazine.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="PoemStanza">
      <p class="PoemLine1">There were no eyes smiling. </p>
      <p class="PoemLine">Mischievous manchild wonderful, straight-necked </p>
      <p class="PoemLine">full-of-tomorrows-boy staring back into the camera.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="PoemStanza">
      <p class="PoemLine1">What was there was not there at all. </p>
      <p class="PoemLine">What was there swallowed the world. </p>
    </div>
    <div class="PoemStanza">
      <p class="PoemLine1">My mama was eight years old when they painted </p>
      <p class="PoemLine">Till’s image on the cover of a negro magazine.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="PoemStanza">
      <p class="PoemLine1">Eight years old. </p>
      <p class="PoemLine">Pigtails, pinafores, pleats, and a heap of pretty girl possibilities. </p>
      <p class="PoemLine">And I know my grandmother set that book down with intention </p>
      <p class="PoemLine">on the coffee table, knowing her baby girl would see it</p>
      <p class="PoemLine">and then know what should not be known but what must be known.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="PoemStanza">
      <p class="PoemLine1">This is what they did with an adolescent mistake.</p>
      <p class="PoemLine">When a fast-talking, finger-snapping negro from up North </p>
      <p class="PoemLine">brags about big city white girl honeys with rosy lips and no Jim Crow,</p>
    </div>
    <div class="PoemStanza">
      <p class="PoemLine1">It is an image I <em>shoved</em> at my fourteen year old son,</p>
      <p class="PoemLine">frenetic in my attempt to tell him that this is black history.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="PoemStanza">
      <p class="PoemLine1">I need him to know</p>
      <p class="PoemLine">if he’s not careful, not brave, </p>
      <p class="PoemLine">not the sum total of all our unlit courage,</p>
      <p class="PoemLine">if he relegates these stories to Cliff’s Notes, </p>
      <p class="PoemLine">he bleeds out and dies in the epilogue.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="PoemStanza">
      <p class="PoemLine1">I need you to know Salih, that my arms will never </p>
      <p class="PoemLine">be wide enough to cover sins like these, </p>
      <p class="PoemLine">that your head, held so high, is still a cautionary tale. </p>
    </div>
    <div class="PoemStanza">
      <p class="PoemLine1">But go on and do it anyway, son. And laugh, </p>
      <p class="PoemLine">and dance with your arms and legs cocked out </p>
      <p class="PoemLine">at odd angles and slip by me and get the extra cornbread </p>
      <p class="PoemLine">whenever you can, and be grateful that when you </p>
      <p class="PoemLine">and your friends say something slick about the pretty blonde </p>
      <p class="PoemLine">girl in the front row of algebra, you are permitted that levity </p>
      <p class="PoemLine">after four hundred years of midnights, </p>
      <p class="PoemLine">necks decorated in nooses, plantations </p>
      <p class="PoemLine">that dressed up terrorism in white </p>
      <p class="PoemLine">lace gloves and mint julep.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="PoemStanza">
      <p class="PoemLine1">I tell my son to remember Emmett Till </p>
      <p class="PoemLine">when his head was still high, his eyes still hazel.</p>
      <p class="PoemLine">Remember how high he held his head to celebrate that new hat.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="PoemStanza">
      <p class="PoemLine1">I tell my son that I will be his mother all the days of my life.</p>
      <p class="PoemLine">That I will celebrate his brown boy buoyancy. </p>
      <p class="PoemLine">And while I do not know what tomorrow holds,</p>
      <p class="PoemLine">I know he will never be strange fruit,</p>
      <p class="PoemLine">Will never be broken open, </p>
      <p class="PoemLine">Will never be strung up,</p>
      <p class="PoemLine">Will never be hog-tied, </p>
      <p class="PoemLine">Will never have his face, so like my own,</p>
      <p class="PoemLine">Crushed, mangled.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="PoemStanza">
      <p class="PoemLine1">I tell my son, </p>

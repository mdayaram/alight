		<p class="PoemLine1">In 1998, in Oakland, California,</p>
		<p class="PoemLine">a 5’11, forty-five year old black man</p>

	</div>
	<div class="PoemStanza">
		<p class="PoemLine1">It was one o’clock in the afternoon.</p>
		<p class="PoemLine">If you ask the Oakland Police Department</p>
		<p class="PoemLine">if there were any suspects, they will tell you</p>
		<p class="PoemLine">the shooting almost seemed to be accidental.</p>
		<p class="PoemLine">That sometimes bullets don’t have agendas,</p>
		<p class="PoemLine">and meetings don’t always take place on street</p>
		<p class="PoemLine">corners. In these parts, these things</p>
		<p class="PoemLine">just happen.</p>

		<p class="PoemLine1">In 2013, the white boy outside the poetry slam venue</p>
		<p class="PoemLine">told me he is so tired of black poets always talking</p>
		<p class="PoemLine">about struggle. Said he clenches his teeth because</p>
		<p class="PoemLine">it is always so damn awkward. Said, There is too much</p>
		<p class="PoemLine">beauty in this Boston skyline to waste breath on oppression.</p>
		<p class="PoemLine">Oppressors never hear the words anyway.</p>

		<p class="PoemLine1">In 1998, in Oakland, California,</p>
		<p class="PoemLine">a 5’11, forty-five year old black man</p>
		<p class="PoemLine">went outside to light a cigarette.</p>
		<p class="PoemLine">Kissed his two children on peak of their hairline,</p>
		<p class="PoemLine">pressed his chest against their foreheads,</p>
		<p class="PoemLine">closed the half-fallen screen door behind him.</p>

	<div class="PoemStanza">
		<p class="PoemLine1">Told them he’d be right back.</p>

		<p class="PoemLine">The ambulance took twenty-five minutes</p>
		<p class="PoemLine">to come on-site. He died instantly.</p>
	</div>
	<div class="PoemStanza">
		<p class="PoemLine1">The Oakland Police would’ve told you</p>
		<p class="PoemLine">he was just at the wrong place at the wrong time.</p>
		<p class="PoemLine">He was just in the wrong house. In the wrong city.</p>
		<p class="PoemLine">He was just the wrong ‘nigga’ in the wrong hood.</p>

	<div class="PoemStanza">	
		<p class="PoemLine1">1998 was the year my father</p>

		<p class="PoemLine">a Smokey Robinson cassette tape to</p>
		<p class="PoemLine">“Tracks of My Tears,” waited 2 minutes</p>
		<p class="PoemLine">into the song to tell me that his brother, my uncle</p>
		<p class="PoemLine">Nathaniel, was gunned down on the splinters</p>
		<p class="PoemLine">of his own front porch while lighting a cigarette.</p>

		<p class="PoemLine1">Said, If you ask the Oakland Police,</p>

	<div class="PoemStanza">
		<p class="PoemLine1">White Boy,</p>
		<p class="PoemLine">don’t talk to me about struggle.</p>
		<p class="PoemLine">Your belly seems to be full</p>
		<p class="PoemLine">of first world problems you choose</p>
		<p class="PoemLine">not to digest, so I write to remind you.</p>
		<p class="PoemLine">Because there is not enough time in the day</p>
		<p class="PoemLine">to remind you there are 300 Sean Bells</p>
		<p class="PoemLine">for every Cornel West. To remind you</p>
		<p class="PoemLine">my uncle didn’t make the evening news.</p>
		<p class="PoemLine">To remind you there were no witnesses.</p>
		<p class="PoemLine">It was one o’clock in the afternoon.</p>

	<div class="PoemStanza">
		<p class="PoemLine1">Yes, we Black Poets tend talk about struggle.</p>
		<p class="PoemLine">We Black Poets tend to lean on broken glass</p>
		<p class="PoemLine">and bleed, trying to communicate our thoughts.</p>
		<p class="PoemLine">We write because we are desperate to fill</p>
		<p class="PoemLine">that awkward silence between our fists</p>
		<p class="PoemLine">and your mouth every time you utter ignorance.</p>
	</div>
	<div class="PoemStanza">
		<p class="PoemLine1">I am sorry if it makes you feel so damn uncomfortable.</p>

	<div class="PoemStanza">
		<p class="PoemLine1">White Boy, I won’t pretend</p>
		<p class="PoemLine">to know your struggle. I won’t pretend</p>
		<p class="PoemLine">I understand the woes of a twenty-two year old</p>
		<p class="PoemLine">white male from Southern Connecticut.</p>
		<p class="PoemLine">I deeply, deeply apologize, White Boy,</p>
		<p class="PoemLine">because I can only imagine how difficult</p>

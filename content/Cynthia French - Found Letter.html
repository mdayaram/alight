	<h4><a href="cfrench-bio">Cynthia French</a></h4>
	<div class="PoemStanza">
		<p class="PoemLine1">I found your poem.</p>
		<p class="PoemLine">That one you performed at the poetry slam.</p>
		<p class="PoemLine">That you posted to YouTube.</p>
		<p class="PoemLine">That your friends tagged me in on Facebook.</p>
		<p class="PoemLine">That you left inconspicuously on the table</p>
		<p class="PoemLine">under the tea service you neglected to bus,</p>
		<p class="PoemLine">despite the signs posted everywhere</p>
		<p class="PoemLine">asking patrons to “Please bus your own dishes.”</p>
	</div>
	<div class="PoemStanza">
		<p class="PoemLine1">I guess you wanted me to find it,</p>
		<p class="PoemLine">but weren’t ballsy enough to just</p>
		<p class="PoemLine">hand it to me yourself. </p>
	</div>
	<div class="PoemStanza">
		<p class="PoemLine1">You know the one,</p>
		<p class="PoemLine">pretty much the same as all the poems</p>
		<p class="PoemLine">all the other poet boys have written</p>
		<p class="PoemLine">to all the other cute barista girls</p>
		<p class="PoemLine">since the dawn of time, or at least</p>
		<p class="PoemLine">since the dawn of espresso machines</p>
		<p class="PoemLine">and cute barista girls. </p>
	</div>
	<div class="PoemStanza">
		<p class="PoemLine1">But yours was <em>different</em>. </p>
		<p class="PoemLine">The way you captured my cuteness</p>
		<p class="PoemLine">with the word cute, and nailed </p>
		<p class="PoemLine">the color of my eyes with the adjective </p>
		<p class="PoemLine"><em>espresso-colored</em>.</p>
	</div>
	<div class="PoemStanza">
		<p class="PoemLine1">How original you are, poet boy! </p>
		<p class="PoemLine">Just like a skim vanilla latte.</p>
	</div>
	<div class="PoemStanza">
		<p class="PoemLine1">You should know skim vanilla lattes are not original. </p>
		<p class="PoemLine">I make at least twenty-seven of them every shift.</p>
		<p class="PoemLine">Skim milk has no body to it.  It’s pretty much water. </p>
		<p class="PoemLine">So you’re kind of like a watered-down, </p>
		<p class="PoemLine">artificially sweetened cup of coffee. </p>
	</div>
	<div class="PoemStanza">
		<p class="PoemLine1">How’s that metaphor—ya? </p>
	</div>
	<div class="PoemStanza">
		<p class="PoemLine1">Also, my eyes aren’t brown. </p>
		<p class="PoemLine">I’ve never seen a hazel espresso bean,</p>
		<p class="PoemLine">and calling me <em>cute</em> isn’t cute. </p>
		<p class="PoemLine">Puppies are cute.  Me, I’m fierce. I’m more </p>
		<p class="PoemLine">avalanche than baby Chihuahua, more dangerous </p>
		<p class="PoemLine">that a pit bull and snottier than a pug.</p>
	</div>
	<div class="PoemStanza">
		<p class="PoemLine1">I did not put vanilla in your mocha because </p>
		<p class="PoemLine">I must have <em>sensed you liked it that way</em>.</p>
		<p class="PoemLine">That shit was not fate,</p>
		<p class="PoemLine">it’s our secret recipe. </p>
	</div>
	<div class="PoemStanza">
		<p class="PoemLine1">I know having your order memorized</p>
		<p class="PoemLine">makes you feel special,</p>
		<p class="PoemLine">but I have everyone’s order memorized. </p>
		<p class="PoemLine">It’s kind of like my job. </p>
		<p class="PoemLine">Which is what this is:  A job. </p>
	</div>
	<div class="PoemStanza">
		<p class="PoemLine1">I don’t come to the library</p>
		<p class="PoemLine">or the cubical at your temp job</p>
		<p class="PoemLine">or your mother’s basement</p>
		<p class="PoemLine">to spy on you while you’re working</p>
		<p class="PoemLine">on your poetry. </p>
	</div>
	<div class="PoemStanza">
		<p class="PoemLine1">I am not waiting for the day</p>
		<p class="PoemLine">you finally get up the courage</p>
		<p class="PoemLine">to tell me you think I’m cute. </p>
	</div>
	<div class="PoemStanza">
		<p class="PoemLine1">I’m waiting for the day you </p>
		<p class="PoemLine">tip me more than a quarter. </p>
		<p class="PoemLine">Seriously, this poor poet </p>
		<p class="PoemLine">thing is played out. </p>
	</div>
	<div class="PoemStanza">
		<p class="PoemLine1">I know how much you spend on</p>
		<p class="PoemLine">coffee and muffins and soup each week.</p>
		<p class="PoemLine">Buy a can of Campbell’s, </p>
		<p class="PoemLine">and leave me a dollar next time. </p>
	</div>
	<div class="PoemStanza">
		<p class="PoemLine1">Then maybe I’ll notice you</p>
		<p class="PoemLine">or something. But probably not. </p>
		<p class="PoemLine">I got my eye on the androgynous punk</p>
		<p class="PoemLine">behind the deli counter down the street. </p>
		<p class="PoemLine">I like the way they cut my meat. </p>
		<p class="PoemLine">It’s real cute. </p>

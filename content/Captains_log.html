    <p class="ProseStanza">The collection you’re about to read is an experiment in artifact creation, and artifacts are strange, in-between things. An artifact is both just itself—a remnant, a tiny piece of a larger and more complicated place and time—and also a diplomatic distillation of the past. It is a set of clues that cannot be figured out, only accepted as evidence. When you or I examine an artifact, we are letting it speak its history in half-erased sentences. It tells us that something happened to make it just exactly as it is, but it cannot ever all the way say how, or what, or why. To fully understand an artifact, we would have had to be there in the making.</p>
    <p class="ProseStanza">In March 2014, hundreds of poets and organizers came together to listen, celebrate, speak, and be challenged at the Women of the World Poetry Slam in Austin, Texas. Over three days and nights of competition, of education, conversation, and careful practice, this festival/tournament lifted women’s creative voices to a place of honor that is rightfully deserved (but still radically significant in our current moment). Aspiring creators were welcomed by their predecessors and encouraged to reach further with fresh tools, genius was spoken and affirmed, new loves blossomed, old alliances took deeper root, laughter poured from roaring crowds, and urgent grief was aired and given tenderness and refuge. It was an intense, fruitful time (also, as with every unchoreographed event, an imperfect one, bearing its own intricacies and complexity) with a lasting impact on many in attendance. Over the course of WoWPS, thousands of people were touched by the craft and passion expressed on its many stages.</p>
    <p class="ProseStanza">The 2014 Women of the World Poetry Slam made a kind of history, and even though the tournament is an annual event, the competitive element holds only a fraction of the gathering’s true significance.  By bringing The Lit Slam to WoWps 2014, my crew and I sought to create a collection that might deliberately capture and preserve at least some of the brilliance expressed at the festival. In addition to holding our own late night side event, we attended every slam in the tournament and asked each audience a simple (but by no means easy) question: Of all the poems you heard tonight, which ones are your favorites? Which  would you want to read again and again?</p>
    <p class="ProseStanza">The pieces with the most votes were then solicited and compiled into this anthology, alongside the winners of The Late Night Lit Slam at WoWPS. (Our event worked like a typical slam, except the judges are treated as “Editors” and asked to evaluate the poetry they heard using the same  question we asked audiences at WoWPS). The hope was that this collection might give future readers a sense of the experience at the 2014 Women of the World Poetry Slam in its totality—a shared footprint for poet and audience, and the living organism they come together as for one night at a time.</p>
    <p class="ProseStanza">As the steward of this collection, I have to accept that so much is lost in the translation from moment to artifact. The screen you’re reading these words on will not convey the transcendent electricity of a poet’s voice as it breaks through to catharsis, nor the shocked breath of silence that naturally swallows her audience between her final line and their erupting applause. These are the last lines that drew that applause. What I have to offer you here is not the heat of the bodies packed into the bars and theatres of Austin, their pulses quickening as they listened, rapt, nor the sweat shed in earnest effort and bravery by the women onstage. Still, printed here, these poems have their own heat.  Alight is not the countless tiny moments that made the audience fall in love with each poem collected herein—the fist raised in defiance, or the relieving embrace of  laughter at a crooked joke at the exact right time. And while it doesn’t explain or describe its origins, Alight was forged by all of these factors. It is a written record of the art that felt unforgettable to the people who shared this experience, though the forces that made it so are now phantoms. If you weren’t in the room, you are being presented with an unsolvable mystery.</p>
    <p class="ProseStanza">And yet I believe it is enough. Having spent painstaking hours collecting , formatting, and wrestling with these poems, my crew at The Lit Slam is nothing short of honored to present this dynamic sample of poetry from the 2014 Women of the World Poetry Slam. We are confident that it will serve its purpose in giving you a glimpse of what was so tremendous the nights these poems were selected. In that pursuit, I can’t help but hope that as you read, you might imagine the moment each piece met the air aloud, and that you let yourself feel included in each piece’s audience, because in making this book happen, we meant for you to be there. We all but saved you a seat in the front row.</p>
    <p class="ProseStanza">If there is anything WoWPS and Alight have both reminded me of again and again, it is that putting attention on the work of marginalized voices speaking as they must (which includes all subjects and rhetorical approaches—silly and sad and angry and anything else that can be dreamt up) is the fastest way to access a sense of humanity, and possibility, and what it really means to be free.  So, should you find at least one thing in this anthology that inspires you (and, considering the breadth of poetry represented in this collection, I imagine that is practically guaranteed), I encourage you to accept it as confirmation that you would also be inspired by the tiny historical moments of finely created and curated local poetry shows the world over—including your hometown. Use this as an excuse to find more art worth being changed by and adoring. Let this collection lead you to listen to (and read) more poets—particularly the woman-identified poets you might otherwise (due to the mechanisms of violence and oppression in our culture) pay less attention to or out and out ignore.</p>

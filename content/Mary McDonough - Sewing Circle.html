  <h4><a href="#mmcdonough-bio">Mary McDonough</a></h4>
  <p class="ProseStanza">Legend has it, my great-great-grandfather killed men for the Union. A sharpshooter. It’s said he returned smelling of solvents and rotten bone. Only able to steady his sights long enough to shoot rotgut. His hands trembled, so he balled them into fists. His wife trembled, so he balled her into a fist. A hard snarl of rage and bone curled up on their bed.</p>
	<p class="ProseStanza">One night, my great-great-grandmother and her sisters sewed him into his sheets as he slept. Six pairs of fists curled around a familiar instrument. His fate, stitched by every tooth he knocked out of her. They sewed him into his sheets &amp; beat him with a bat.</p>
	<p class="ProseStanza">When he regained consciousness in the hospital 3 days later, my great-great-grandmother looked into the eyes of my great-great-grandfather &amp; said, <em>If you ever touch me again, I will kill you.</em></p>
	<p class="ProseStanza">Sewing: The domesticity implied in its mastering, the definition of women’s work. Embroidery samplers originated in the 15th century, a test of skill. The only time a woman would write or read her own name before it belonged to her husband. I read the news &amp; my hands teach themselves to sew. Headlines are ugly patterned embroidery samplers threaded into the statistics of neural pathways.</p>
	<p class="ProseStanza">Like I know, as you know, 1 billion women have been victims of gendered violence.</p>
	<p class="ProseStanza">Sewing circles came about in towns where war had robbed every woman of her husband or her brother or her son. And right now there is a country full of women, three times the population of the United States, that have been robbed of their autonomy, their dignity, their faith.</p>
  	<div class="PoemStanza">
		<p class="PoemLine1">So, this is an invitation to a sewing circle.</p>
		<p class="PoemLine">Can you imagine the sound of 1 billion pairs of hands sewing?</p>
	</div>
	<div class="PoemStanza">
		<p class="PoemLine1">Our needles: as ancient &amp; as common as vertebra.</p>
		<p class="PoemLine">Our stories: decaying family heirlooms hung in dusty hallways.</p>
	</div>
	<div class="PoemStanza">
		<p class="PoemLine1">To be a woman is to be a wedding quilt on a child’s bed.</p>
		<p class="PoemLine">I am the warmth the you sleep beneath</p>
		<p class="PoemLine">without ever having to understand the labor inherent in its creation.</p>
	</div>
	<div class="PoemStanza">
		<p class="PoemLine1">Sometimes I want to sew the world into its sheets.</p>
		<p class="PoemLine">I want to beat it with a bat until the warning sticks</p>
		<p class="PoemLine">like blood to linen. My sisters &amp; me, bats &amp; bricks</p>
		<p class="PoemLine">&amp; beams in hand—can you imagine: every rape choking</p>
		<p class="PoemLine">on its own teeth. Every catcall and roofie a detached retina.</p>
		<p class="PoemLine">Every red light district a collapsed lung.</p>
	</div>
	<div class="PoemStanza">
		<p class="PoemLine1">Would they still rape us if they knew our cunts</p>
		<p class="PoemLine">were made of sewing needles?</p>
		<p class="PoemLine">Would they still rape us if they knew our skin</p>
		<p class="PoemLine">is a spool of thread dipped in broken glass?</p>
	</div>
	<div class="PoemStanza">
		<p class="PoemLine1">I want to sew the world into its sheets</p>
		<p class="PoemLine">I want to sew Steubenville into its sheets</p>
		<p class="PoemLine">I want to sew Juarez into its sheets</p>
		<p class="PoemLine">I want to sew my own self-hatred into its sheets.</p>

	<div class="PoemStanza">
		<p class="PoemLine1">This is an invitation</p>

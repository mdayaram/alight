      <p class="PoemLine"><em>you just ain’t that lucky</em>. Suddenly, </p>
      <p class="PoemLine">your body is a cathedral of <em>no</em>, shouting at the joints.</p>
      <p class="PoemLine">This is the day you are found by your body.</p>
      <p class="PoemLine">This is the day its black stops hunting you.</p>

      <p class="PoemLine"><em>Look, Jimmy. This blood looks just like yours, and so what</em></p>
      <p class="PoemLine"><em>if it screams just a little bit louder. This brown is a small thorn</em>,</p>

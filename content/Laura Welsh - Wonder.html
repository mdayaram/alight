  <h4><a href="lwelsh-bio">Laura Welsh</a></h4>
  <div class="PoemStanza">
    <p class="PoemLine1">Most of the time, I can’t sleep.</p>
    <p class="PoemLine">And even on the nights I find myself asleep, </p>
    <p class="PoemLine">my mind stays awake, victimized </p>
    <p class="PoemLine">by your voice in my dreams.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="PoemStanza">
    <p class="PoemLine1">I can’t help but wonder about your overdose,</p>
    <p class="PoemLine">and how it must have sounded when your soul </p>
    <p class="PoemLine">bubbled and frothed up out of your mouth,</p>
    <p class="PoemLine">and if you were scared when you woke up </p>
    <p class="PoemLine">dying and alone—just like sometimes I wonder </p>
    <p class="PoemLine">why, four years later, your number is still kept in my phone.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="PoemStanza">
    <p class="PoemLine1">And if I were to call it right now, </p>
    <p class="PoemLine">would a strange woman’s voice answer </p>
    <p class="PoemLine">in a monotone to tell me there was no longer </p>
    <p class="PoemLine">service to the sounds of your pulse.</p>
    <p class="PoemLine">And that wherever your dreams sailed you to </p>
    <p class="PoemLine">has no area code. So I can never tell you </p>
    <p class="PoemLine">that I am still mad at you.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="PoemStanza">
    <p class="PoemLine1">I know it was not your intention </p>
    <p class="PoemLine">to die. You only meant to get high, </p>
    <p class="PoemLine">but you were never supposed to go.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="PoemStanza">
    <p class="PoemLine1">So some nights I find myself asleep and alone,</p>
    <p class="PoemLine">and I wake up to wonder if I’m a bad person, </p>
    <p class="PoemLine">because I would never trade places with you.</p>
    <p class="PoemLine">And I took the pills too.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="PoemStanza">
    <p class="PoemLine1">So I just need to hear your voice tell me</p>
    <p class="PoemLine">because I know now, that you know:</p>
    <p class="PoemLine">Are these voices a sign?</p>
    <p class="PoemLine">Is there too much or too little of God in my mind?</p>
  </div>
  <div class="PoemStanza">
    <p class="PoemLine1">So sometimes I wonder how an angel’s voice sounds.</p>
    <p class="PoemLine">I imagine it has to be something like the way your voice sounded</p>
    <p class="PoemLine">when your body finally flipped over, and down.</p>
    <p class="PoemLine">And how my ears curdled, as your throat seemed to implode,</p>
    <p class="PoemLine">setting loose the most inhuman, unearthly sound.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="PoemStanza">
    <p class="PoemLine1">I knew then, as the sky came unskinned,</p>
    <p class="PoemLine">that nothing had ever, could ever, would ever be whole again.</p>
    <p class="PoemLine">If I had to guess, that moment was the sound</p>
    <p class="PoemLine">of a band of angels using a human’s mouth</p>
    <p class="PoemLine">to tear open the clouds and raise up your soul</p>
    <p class="PoemLine">to a place of wonder that is not yet my time to know.</p>

	<h4><a href="#ogatwood-bio">Olivia Gatwood</a></h4>
	<div>
		<p class="PoemLine1">It is hard for me to look </p>
		<p class="PoemLine">at a family photograph</p>
		<p class="PoemLine">and not see you</p>
		<p class="PoemLine">in the background.</p>
	</div>
	<div class="PoemStanza">
		<p class="PoemLine1">You sit </p>
		<p class="PoemLine">in my father’s wrinkles</p>
		<p class="PoemLine">and my mother’s unsure smile.</p>
		<p class="PoemLine">You are prying their bodies apart</p>
		<p class="PoemLine">with your late night phone calls.</p>
	</div>
	<div class="PoemStanza">
		<p class="PoemLine1">I have never known your voice,</p>
		<p class="PoemLine">but I can still hear you</p>
		<p class="PoemLine">calling me a firecracker</p>
	</div>
	<div class="PoemStanza">
		<p class="PoemLine1 PoemLine1Indent2"><em>She’s just like her mother,</em></p>
		<p class="PoemLine">you say.</p>
	</div>
	<div class="PoemStanza">
		<p class="PoemLine1">I cannot tell you how many times</p>
		<p class="PoemLine">I’ve laid awake at night rehearsing </p>
		<p class="PoemLine">what I would do if I ever saw you </p>
		<p class="PoemLine">on the street. I have rattled this </p>
		<p class="PoemLine">scenario on replay over and over, </p>
		<p class="PoemLine">pushed myself to the edge</p>
		<p class="PoemLine">at the thought of your touch,</p>
		<p class="PoemLine">stared at the bones in my knuckles</p>
		<p class="PoemLine">for countless hours, wondering</p>
		<p class="PoemLine">how much damage </p>
		<p class="PoemLine">I am capable of causing.</p>
	</div>
	<div class="PoemStanza">
		<p class="PoemLine1">If I ever saw you on the street</p>
		<p class="PoemLine">I would probably forget everything </p>
		<p class="PoemLine">I was supposed to say at that moment.</p>
		<p class="PoemLine">And you would not know who I am.</p>
	</div>
	<div class="PoemStanza">
		<p class="PoemLine1">But if you looked closely,</p>
		<p class="PoemLine">you would see my mother’s gapped teeth.</p>
		<p class="PoemLine">You would see her skinny legs and oval face,</p>
		<p class="PoemLine">you would see her in my crooked fingers.</p>
	</div>
	<div class="PoemStanza">
		<p class="PoemLine1">If you looked closely,</p>
		<p class="PoemLine">you would know I am the daughter </p>
		<p class="PoemLine">of the woman you tried to steal.</p>
	</div>
	<div class="PoemStanza">
		<p class="PoemLine1">I have watched you in the emails you sent her,</p>
		<p class="PoemLine">stared at the return address of the gifts you mailed.</p>
		<p class="PoemLine">Looked up bus prices to see how much it would cost</p>
		<p class="PoemLine">to show up on your doorstep and tell you </p>
		<p class="PoemLine">everything my father wishes he could say.</p>
	</div>
	<div class="PoemStanza">
		<p class="PoemLine1">I knew your name </p>
		<p class="PoemLine">before you even knew your lover’s child.</p>
		<p class="PoemLine">I knew it was you in the lace,</p>
		<p class="PoemLine">in the black,</p>
		<p class="PoemLine">in the silhouette dress.</p>
		<p class="PoemLine">I know what you like in a woman</p>
		<p class="PoemLine">and that woman is not your wife.</p>
	</div>
	<div class="PoemStanza">
		<p class="PoemLine1">I know why you loved my mother.</p>
		<p class="PoemLine">I have watched my dad love the same things </p>
		<p class="PoemLine">on the hammock in the backyard.</p>
		<p class="PoemLine">He holds her face like a ripe plum,</p>
		<p class="PoemLine">and smiles into her. </p>
	</div>
	<div class="PoemStanza">
		<p class="PoemLine1">When he looks at her, he sees youth.</p>
		<p class="PoemLine">The woman who showed him the mountains,</p>
		<p class="PoemLine">who made him believe in loving someone </p>
		<p class="PoemLine">with every ounce  of your own being.</p>
		<p class="PoemLine">The woman who gave him a family.</p>
		<p class="PoemLine">When he looks at my mother, he sees me.</p>
		<p class="PoemLine">But Calvin,</p>
		<p class="PoemLine">what did you see?</p>
	</div>
	<div class="PoemStanza">
		<p class="PoemLine1">Did you see the awkward car ride home</p>
		<p class="PoemLine">after we picked up your scent at the airport?</p>
		<p class="PoemLine">Or the rock that sat in Daddy’s throat </p>
		<p class="PoemLine">when he smelled you?</p>
		<p class="PoemLine">Did you see that?</p>
	</div>
	<div class="PoemStanza">
		<p class="PoemLine1">Or did you just take the woman </p>
		<p class="PoemLine">who was too fragile to carry </p>
		<p class="PoemLine">her own backbone and smother her </p>
		<p class="PoemLine">in your heavy compliments?</p>
	</div>
	<div class="PoemStanza">
		<p class="PoemLine1">She still walks with broken knees</p>
		<p class="PoemLine">and touches my father as though he </p>
		<p class="PoemLine">will crumble at any moment.</p>
		<p class="PoemLine">Our home has become a pile of sticks </p>
		<p class="PoemLine">in an empty plain where the slightest </p>
		<p class="PoemLine">reference of your relations will </p>
		<p class="PoemLine">send us into a fucking windstorm</p>
	</div>
	<div class="PoemStanza">
		<p class="PoemLine1">I never speak of the town where you first met her.</p>
		<p class="PoemLine">I don’t complain about the boy who cheated on me, </p>
		<p class="PoemLine">or the politicians who are screwing the housemaid.</p>
	</div>
	<div class="PoemStanza">
		<p class="PoemLine1">I give bad reviews to movies with infidelity </p>
		<p class="PoemLine">in their plot lines and swallow my gushing </p>
		<p class="PoemLine">of beautiful love stories hoping they </p>
		<p class="PoemLine">will never be reminded of you.</p>
	</div>
	<div class="PoemStanza">
		<p class="PoemLine1">You are the blister on my family’s tongue,</p>
	</div>
	<div class="PoemStanza">
		<p class="PoemLine1">so when you decide to make another appearance</p>
		<p class="PoemLine">in this crooked frame, this autopsy of a household</p>
		<p class="PoemLine">on this eggshell bridge of a doorstep,</p>
		<p class="PoemLine">don’t go looking for my mother.</p>
	</div>
	<div class="PoemStanza">
		<p class="PoemLine1">Come looking</p>
		<p class="PoemLine">for Me.</p>
	</div>

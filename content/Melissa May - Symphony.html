		<p class="PoemLine1">This is my body,</p>
		<p class="PoemLine">not a fumbling mass </p>
		<p class="PoemLine">of flesh and limb.</p>
		<p class="PoemLine">It is a concert hall.</p>
		<p class="PoemLine">An orchestra:</p>
		<p class="PoemLine">Philharmonic-Erectus.</p>
	</div>
	<div class="PoemStanza">
		<p class="PoemLine1">The liver is a low-sliding trombone. </p>
		<p class="PoemLine">Sounds like jazz and Creole coastline,</p>
		<p class="PoemLine">smells like Bourbon Street.</p>
		<p class="PoemLine">Can no longer properly</p>
		<p class="PoemLine">filter out the bad notes,</p>
		<p class="PoemLine">Lets sour music infect the bloodstream.</p>

		<p class="PoemLine1">Pancreas: contrabassoon,</p>
		<p class="PoemLine">lowest instrument in the entire orchestra,</p>
		<p class="PoemLine">reaches so far down on the clef that it is felt</p>
		<p class="PoemLine">(rather than heard) in your teeth, your fingertips.</p>
		<p class="PoemLine">Felt in your fingertips, when it forgets the music</p>
		<p class="PoemLine">that is where it is felt. Blood drawn, tested.</p>
		<p class="PoemLine">Insulin injections are the only instruments that</p>

		<p class="PoemLine1">Nerves: kettle drum, bass drum, cymbal snare.</p>
		<p class="PoemLine">They snap and fire under too much pressure.</p>
		<p class="PoemLine">They are untuned and wild and insistent,</p>
		<p class="PoemLine">the nervous system houses the maestro who</p>
		<p class="PoemLine">has lost control of his musicians.</p>

	<div class="PoemStanza">
		<p class="PoemLine1">Heart: first violin.</p>

		<p class="PoemLine1">It is a hard truth, to stand guilty in</p>
		<p class="PoemLine">the mirror and face the empty opera boxes,</p>
		<p class="PoemLine">the naked stage of belly. To realize you were given </p>
		<p class="PoemLine">to this world in all the right keys, now rusted, sharp. </p>
		<p class="PoemLine">tone deaf.</p>

  <div class="PoemStanza">
    <p class="PoemLine">The man behind the bodega counter</p>
    <p class="PoemLine">asked me if I <em>could deep throat</em>?</p>
  </div>
  <div class="PoemStanza">
    <p class="PoemLine1">Said,</p>
  </div>
  <div class="PoemStanza">
    <p class="PoemLine"><em>You look like the kind of girl who can swallow</em>,</p>
    <p class="PoemLine"><em>who can make a man forget that his girl</em> </p>
    <p class="PoemLine"><em>doesn&rsquo;t do certain things</em></p>
  </div>
  <div class="PoemStanza">
    <p class="PoemLine1">In an attempt to respond,</p>
    <p class="PoemLine">I thought:</p>
  </div>
  <div class="PoemStanza">
    <p class="PoemLine1">Irrational of me,</p>
    <p class="PoemLine">to be both woman and hungry,</p>
    <p class="PoemLine">to confuse myself with the kind </p>
    <p class="PoemLine">of person who has rights.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="PoemStanza">
    <p class="PoemLine1">To be woman and house a body </p>
    <p class="PoemLine">is to break all the floors. </p>
    <p class="PoemLine">Is to know most men think your mouth a door.</p>
    <p class="PoemLine">Think your mouth always open.</p>
    <p class="PoemLine">Think you steadfast&mdash;ready, </p>
    <p class="PoemLine">Think you beckon their call.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="PoemStanza">
    <p class="PoemLine1">Their call loud as sirens,</p>
    <p class="PoemLine">their sirens break all the windows.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="PoemStanza">
    <p class="PoemLine">You, woman, house a body, </p>
    <p class="PoemLine">that stay breaking. </p>
  </div>
  <div class="PoemStanza">
    <p class="PoemLine1">Creaking men think the fragments are an opening, </p>
    <p class="PoemLine">walk through you like your walls are an invitation,</p>
    <p class="PoemLine">run their fingers through all your panels. </p>
  </div>
  <div class="PoemStanza">
    <p class="PoemLine1">You don&rsquo;t recall thinking yourself </p>
    <p class="PoemLine">welcome mat, except for the fact that you </p>
    <p class="PoemLine">came out the womb both woman and body. </p>
    <p class="PoemLine">And men, like most people, want to crawl </p>
    <p class="PoemLine">back into that body.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="PoemStanza">
    <p class="PoemLine1">And you, woman, are a body </p>
    <p class="PoemLine">that both absorbs and expels, </p>
    <p class="PoemLine">so naturally, you the first they coming for.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="PoemStanza">
    <p class="PoemLine1">Dare speak?</p>
    <p class="PoemLine"><em>Bitch</em>.</p>
    <p class="PoemLine"><em>Feminist</em>. </p>
    <p class="PoemLine"><em>Man basher</em>, </p>
    <p class="PoemLine">even though you ain&rsquo;t bashing all men, </p>
    <p class="PoemLine">just the men who treat women and think </p>
    <p class="PoemLine">this kind of way.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="PoemStanza">
    <p class="PoemLine">Still you&rsquo;re <em>man-hater</em>,</p>
    <p class="PoemLine">you be mad lonely. </p>
  </div>
  <div class="PoemStanza">
    <p class="PoemLine1"><em>Ain&rsquo;t no man gonna love you</em></p>
    <p class="PoemLine">echoed loudly.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="PoemStanza">
    <p class="PoemLine1">Like that&rsquo;s the only accomplishment </p>
    <p class="PoemLine">us women strive for.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="PoemStanza">
    <p class="PoemLine1">Like that&rsquo;s the only role us women play.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="PoemStanza">
    <p class="PoemLine1">Patriarchy so evident,</p>
    <p class="PoemLine">it seeps through every floor you got, </p>
    <p class="PoemLine">until everyone is calling you out your name.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="PoemStanza">
    <p class="PoemLine1">You, no longer Stacy,</p>
    <p class="PoemLine">you whore from downtown.</p>
    <p class="PoemLine">Head game so good,</p>
    <p class="PoemLine">got a man walking in the right direction. </p>
  </div>
  <div class="PoemStanza">
    <p class="PoemLine1">See how quickly you become </p>
    <p class="PoemLine">a mouth again? A cavity? </p>
  </div>
  <div class="PoemStanza">
    <p class="PoemLine1">Half temple and brothel,</p>
    <p class="PoemLine">both cathedral and jezebel,</p>
    <p class="PoemLine">cattle and disparaged. </p>
  </div>
  <div class="PoemStanza">
    <p class="PoemLine1">You are not just dressed up,</p>
    <p class="PoemLine">high-heels, stomping pavement.</p>
    <p class="PoemLine">You, you asking for it</p>
  </div>
  <div class="PoemStanza">
    <p class="PoemLine1">as if your body </p>
    <p class="PoemLine">were an eager child </p>
    <p class="PoemLine">who can&rsquo;t use its words.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="PoemStanza">
    <p class="PoemLine1">You, woman, can&rsquo;t form words but movement.</p>
    <p class="PoemLine">Movement demands attention, </p>
    <p class="PoemLine">attention says you deserve everything </p>
    <p class="PoemLine">you get, regardless if you wanted it.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="PoemStanza">
    <p class="PoemLine1">Because, what do you know of desire </p>
    <p class="PoemLine">except for what is told to you?</p>
  </div>
  <div class="PoemStanza">
    <p class="PoemLine1">What do you know of your body,</p>
    <p class="PoemLine">except for what is told to you?</p>
  </div>
  <div class="PoemStanza">
    <p class="PoemLine1">Who are you except for what is needed from you? </p>
  </div>
  <div class="PoemStanza">
    <p class="PoemLine1">What is needed from you other than a mouth </p>
    <p class="PoemLine">and the right kind of softness?</p>
  </div>
  <div class="PoemStanza">
    <p class="PoemLine1">So, I stood there,</p>
    <p class="PoemLine">my jaw a waving flag,</p>
    <p class="PoemLine">legs the right kind </p>
    <p class="PoemLine">of run ready, and said: </p>

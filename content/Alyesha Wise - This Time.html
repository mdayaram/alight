	<div class="PoemStanza">
		<p class="PoemLine1">...there will be a celebration.</p>
		<p class="PoemLine">They will speak of deliverance, say </p>
		<p class="PoemLine"><em>God is good</em>, as if She wasn’t the last time.</p>
	</div>
	<div class="PoemStanza">
		<p class="PoemLine1">This time, there will be talk of babies</p>
		<p class="PoemLine">out of my vagina—as if babies couldn’t </p>
		<p class="PoemLine">come out of my vagina before.</p>
	</div>
	<div class="PoemStanza">
		<p class="PoemLine1">My mother will pick up the phone,</p>
		<p class="PoemLine">call <em>all</em> of her friends—proud.</p>
		<p class="PoemLine">Make plans for a dinner party </p>
		<p class="PoemLine">I am not invited to.</p>
		<p class="PoemLine">This was never about me.</p>
	</div>
	<div class="PoemStanza">
		<p class="PoemLine1">This time, they will rejoice.</p>
		<p class="PoemLine">Ask about marriage plans </p>
		<p class="PoemLine">before they memorize his last name,</p>
		<p class="PoemLine">but at least they will memorize his last name.</p>
	</div>
	<div class="PoemStanza">
		<p class="PoemLine1">My friends, the straight ones,</p>
		<p class="PoemLine">will utter violent words, say</p>
		<p class="PoemLine"><em>I’m glad you no longer think you are a man.</em></p>
		<p class="PoemLine">And with all the pain shooting from my toes,</p>
		<p class="PoemLine">I’ll want to yell out: <em>No! I never thought</em></p>
		<p class="PoemLine"><em>I was a man, but being with a man</em></p>
		<p class="PoemLine"><em>doesn’t make me feel any more like a woman!</em></p>
	</div>
	<div class="PoemStanza">
		<p class="PoemLine1">This time, my friends,</p>
		<p class="PoemLine">the not-so-straight ones,</p>
		<p class="PoemLine">will utter violent words </p>
		<p class="PoemLine">at dinner parties and rallies</p>
		<p class="PoemLine">which I am no longer invited to.</p>
		<p class="PoemLine">This was never about me,</p>
		<p class="PoemLine">and when they are forced </p>
		<p class="PoemLine">to look me in the eyes,</p>
		<p class="PoemLine">they will keep their words </p>
		<p class="PoemLine">tucked in a safe space,</p>
		<p class="PoemLine">smile, and say, <em>It’s ok.</em></p>
		<p class="PoemLine"><em>Sexuality is fluid.</em></p>
	</div>
	<div class="PoemStanza">
		<p class="PoemLine1">They will strip me</p>
		<p class="PoemLine">from every poem, protest.</p>
		<p class="PoemLine">They will not ask me if he is a phase.</p>
	</div>
	<div class="PoemStanza">
		<p class="PoemLine1">My straight friends will say:</p>
		<p class="PoemLine"><em>Girl, I knew all that was a phase.</em></p>
		<p class="PoemLine">I will be an animal in the middle </p>
		<p class="PoemLine">of a caged ring while they all stare,</p>
		<p class="PoemLine">fixated on the phase that fits them best.</p>
		<p class="PoemLine">They will cheer me on—They will cheer me off.</p>
		<p class="PoemLine">Both sides will make me an example </p>
		<p class="PoemLine">of what not to do.</p>
	</div>
	<div class="PoemStanza">
		<p class="PoemLine1">But my father.</p>
		<p class="PoemLine">Oh, my father.</p>
		<p class="PoemLine">This time,</p>
		<p class="PoemLine">like the last time</p>
		<p class="PoemLine">and all the times before,</p>
		<p class="PoemLine">he will pick up the phone,</p>
		<p class="PoemLine">proud. Ask, <em>Are you happy?</em></p>
		<p class="PoemLine"><em>Good. Now, how was your day?</em></p>
	</div>
	<div class="PoemStanza">
		<p class="PoemLine1">I wish they could all be like my father.</p>
		<p class="PoemLine">I wish they would all wear their judgments </p>
		<p class="PoemLine">like love. Then maybe they would understand </p>
		<p class="PoemLine">why I always wanted to fit into my father’s pants.</p>
	</div>
	<div class="PoemStanza">
		<p class="PoemLine1">There is something about love without much restriction,</p>
		<p class="PoemLine">something about love without many rules and regulations.</p>
		<p class="PoemLine">For I can recall wanting to punch a girl for trying to kiss me,</p>
		<p class="PoemLine">buried beneath secret tongue taps until my fist bloomed </p>
		<p class="PoemLine">with the first pussy in front of my eyes.</p>
		<p class="PoemLine">That moment, I plucked most of my fears away.</p>
	</div>
	<div class="PoemStanza">
		<p class="PoemLine1">And I can recall a man telling me </p>
		<p class="PoemLine">that I just didn’t find the right one.</p>
		<p class="PoemLine">And I wanted to punch words into his face:</p>
		<p class="PoemLine"><em>If only you knew what women put women through,</em></p>
		<p class="PoemLine"><em>you would not sound so stupid!</em></p>
	</div>
	<div class="PoemStanza">
		<p class="PoemLine1">And I can recall, not too long after,</p>
		<p class="PoemLine">when my fist hardened with the first </p>
		<p class="PoemLine">male erection between my thighs</p>
		<p class="PoemLine">in eight years. And as we released,</p>
		<p class="PoemLine">I still wanted to punch that man in the face.</p>
	</div>
	<div class="PoemStanza">
		<p class="PoemLine1">But I released so many wasted moments,</p>
		<p class="PoemLine">infuriated towards those who have only </p>
		<p class="PoemLine">experienced love in limited forms,</p>
		<p class="PoemLine">who haven’t swallowed feminism.</p>
	</div>
	<div class="PoemStanza">
		<p class="PoemLine1">We have all taken fear deep in </p>
		<p class="PoemLine">the back of our throats, knowing </p>
		<p class="PoemLine">very well it is what we all really taste like.</p>
	</div>
	<div class="PoemStanza">
		<p class="PoemLine1">With all the experiences shooting from my chest,</p>
		<p class="PoemLine">I want to yell out: <em>This transformation does not</em></p>
		<p class="PoemLine"><em>define this womanhood! It defines the power</em></p>
		<p class="PoemLine"><em>to adapt to any love that shelters!</em></p>
		<p class="PoemLine"><em>Houses this heart!</em></p>
		<p class="PoemLine"><em>Feels like home!</em></p>
		<p class="PoemLine"><em>That only light can build,</em></p>
		<p class="PoemLine"><em>but no stone can break</em></p>
	</div>
	<div class="PoemStanza">
		<p class="PoemLine1"><em>This time.</em></p>

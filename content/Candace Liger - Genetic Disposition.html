	<div class="PoemStanza">
		<p class="PoemLine">When I was four, I taught myself how to eat </p>
		<p class="PoemLine">the entire world. It took me until six to find out </p>
		<p class="PoemLine">what flavor the Mississippi Delta wind was.</p>
		<p class="PoemLine">And much like any place in the South, the aroma </p>
		<p class="PoemLine">was intoxicating with dead bodies and Bibles.</p>
	</div>
	<div class="PoemStanza">
		<p class="PoemLine1">My father—a man with branches for arms,</p>
		<p class="PoemLine">poetry as magnolia flowers, and roots forming </p>
		<p class="PoemLine">his insecurities—taught me early that leaving home</p>
		<p class="PoemLine">wasn’t as hard as biting his own bark.</p>
	</div>
	<div class="PoemStanza">
		<p class="PoemLine1">He wrote poetry. Simple and humble.</p>
		<p class="PoemLine">And every Valentine’s day I would receive his Love </p>
		<p class="PoemLine">shiny enough to reflect my scars.</p>
	</div>
	<div class="PoemStanza">
		<p class="PoemLine1">With age, the poetry became alive.</p>
		<p class="PoemLine">With age, he became closer to death.</p>
		<p class="PoemLine">and eventually it became too hard to digest.</p>
	</div>
	<div class="PoemStanza">
		<p class="PoemLine1">My scars were displaced </p>
		<p class="PoemLine">in soil. Love bled in and out </p>
		<p class="PoemLine">of our lesions. We all learned </p>
		<p class="PoemLine">to use knives to cut away pain</p>
		<p class="PoemLine">And when daddy’s poetry became </p>
		<p class="PoemLine">nothing more than a drunk stagger, </p>
		<p class="PoemLine">I mutilated the memory on my body. </p>
	</div>
	<div class="PoemStanza">
		<p class="PoemLine1">At 13 I stopped writing. Never for lack </p>
		<p class="PoemLine">of inspiration. Maybe a lack of desire </p>
		<p class="PoemLine">to convert another storybook into a riddle. </p>
	</div>
	<div class="PoemStanza">
		<p class="PoemLine1">I watched in silence. I watched his body </p>
		<p class="PoemLine">eat its own existence. Always using scars </p>
		<p class="PoemLine">passed down from generations </p>
		<p class="PoemLine">of dystrophy and disease.</p>
	</div>
	<div class="PoemStanza">
		<p class="PoemLine1">Some say that some old lady placed a root </p>
		<p class="PoemLine">on his grandfather that passed down generations</p>
		<p class="PoemLine">and plagued every child with illness and creativity.</p>
	</div>
	<div class="PoemStanza">
		<p class="PoemLine1">It didn’t take long for me to notice</p>
		<p class="PoemLine">how quiet the world became</p>
		<p class="PoemLine">to someone who wasn’t finely broken like the soil.</p>
	</div>
	<div class="PoemStanza">
		<p class="PoemLine1">By 18, I lost my virginity on the fourth of July</p>
		<p class="PoemLine">to man who never heard a woman scream.</p>
		<p class="PoemLine">I blame that on my legs.</p>
	</div>
	<div class="PoemStanza">
		<p class="PoemLine1">Whatever voice I had was a stitched wound </p>
		<p class="PoemLine">over his ego. Between his fireworks </p>
		<p class="PoemLine">and my daddy’s wheelchair,</p>
		<p class="PoemLine">I can’t recall which one</p>
		<p class="PoemLine">protested God’s physics.</p>
	</div>
	<div class="PoemStanza">
		<p class="PoemLine1">I didn’t want to remember he existed.</p>
		<p class="PoemLine">He, barely breathing and muffled in voice,</p>
		<p class="PoemLine">tried desperately to force the sounds </p>
		<p class="PoemLine">from his throat into a poem. </p>
		<p class="PoemLine">But all I could ever hear was the sound</p>
		<p class="PoemLine">of his inferior genetic makeup.</p>
	</div>
	<div class="PoemStanza">
		<p class="PoemLine1">These scars aren’t a testimony </p>
		<p class="PoemLine">of rebellion, but rather what’s left of years </p>
		<p class="PoemLine">of closed eyes and misunderstood looks.</p>
	</div>
	<div class="PoemStanza">
		<p class="PoemLine1">My scars lay on his deathbed.</p>
		<p class="PoemLine">Before I could kiss his forehead</p>
		<p class="PoemLine">I couldn’t help but think</p>
		<p class="PoemLine">that if my scars reflected his,</p>
		<p class="PoemLine">would I too have Lonely drifting from my eyes?</p>
	</div>
	<div class="PoemStanza">
		<p class="PoemLine1">Would I be sensitive to the heat of the Sun?</p>
		<p class="PoemLine">Would my voice be strong enough to whisper</p>
		<p class="PoemLine"><em>I love you</em> in my daughter’s ear,</p>
		<p class="PoemLine">or would I be forced to eat myself whole</p>
		<p class="PoemLine">until I was vegetated and still hungry?</p>
	</div>
	<div class="PoemStanza">
		<p class="PoemLine1">I prayed death to him.</p>
		<p class="PoemLine">My soul could no longer hold </p>
		<p class="PoemLine">his deterioration of body,</p>
		<p class="PoemLine">though his mind was intact.</p>
		<p class="PoemLine">I missed his poetry.</p>
		<p class="PoemLine">Those words.</p>
		<p class="PoemLine">I missed his height…</p>
		<p class="PoemLine">And his weight…</p>
		<p class="PoemLine">And his voice.</p>
	</div>
	<div class="PoemStanza">
		<p class="PoemLine1">Tell me that you see my scars</p>
		<p class="PoemLine">and the pieces leftover from them.</p>
	</div>
	<div class="PoemStanza">
		<p class="PoemLine1">I’;ll write my poetry,</p>
		<p class="PoemLine">type it loudly on keyboards</p>
		<p class="PoemLine">Hoping to recreate any sound like</p>
		<p class="PoemLine">I once heard from my father’s woodwork.</p>
		<p class="PoemLine">Sometimes with my eyes closed, hoping </p>
		<p class="PoemLine">I would see him on Valentine’s day,</p>
		<p class="PoemLine">when love knew no funny gestures</p>
		<p class="PoemLine">or awkward shifts in conversation…</p>
		<p class="PoemLine">When the world didn’;t look so much like one needle,</p>
		<p class="PoemLine">and a million bleeding wounds. When I was flawless.</p>
		<p class="PoemLine">And I guess that was when you were, too.</p>
	</div>
	<div class="PoemStanza">
		<p class="PoemLine1">For now, we all should feel lucky.</p>
		<p class="PoemLine">Our bodies can still hold all the pieces</p>
		<p class="PoemLine">left over from planets crashing into space.</p>
	</div>
	<div class="PoemStanza">
		<p class="PoemLine1">Lucky we have legs</p>
		<p class="PoemLine">and eyes and a voice.</p>
		<p class="PoemLine">If you want to know how I got my scars,</p>
		<p class="PoemLine">open them all and ask me.</p>

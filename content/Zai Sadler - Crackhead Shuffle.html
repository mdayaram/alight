	<div class="PoemStanza">
		<p class="PoemLine1">So there’s this new dance. Its called the crackhead shuffle</p>
		<p class="PoemLine">A not so subtle, not so simple dance with one step: Move,</p>
		<p class="PoemLine">move to the best block, move to yo’ next rock. Rock and</p>
		<p class="PoemLine">nod a bob, but can’t stop, won’t stop, like the Roc</p>
		<p class="PoemLine">but the only thing that rocks this fella is a hella fire</p>
		<p class="PoemLine">internal beat, that won’t let his hella tired feet cease from</p>
		<p class="PoemLine">singeing sorry streets soured with smoke and shame</p>
		<p class="PoemLine">lames who let the game play them. Those who probably</p>
		<p class="PoemLine">let the 80’s pay them. And now they’re paying for it</p>
		<p class="PoemLine">Mama said, “Everybody’s got a dancer in the family right?”</p>
		<p class="PoemLine">One that can two step around twelve. Who tap dances in shoes</p>
		<p class="PoemLine">he only intends to sell, but he digs blues. And jazz,</p>
		<p class="PoemLine">and rap, and rock. Yeah, nothin’s like rocks.</p>
		<p class="PoemLine">That shit will knock your socks off. Like great sex.</p>
		<p class="PoemLine">Like cheap latex. It can bust and break and birth</p>
		<p class="PoemLine">new generations stuck singing the same song. On the same</p>
		<p class="PoemLine">station. Searching for a rhythm that resembles that first fist fight</p>
		<p class="PoemLine">with your father. That first time you ignored brother and stole</p>
		<p class="PoemLine">from mother. That first fix was was supposed to fix all that.</p>
		<p class="PoemLine">Did it? Did it?</p>
		<p class="PoemLine">Now you’re stuck shuffling your two left feet</p>
		<p class="PoemLine">searching for a dream of a life thats just in your reach</p>
		<p class="PoemLine">like toothbrushes and toothpaste. Trying to scrape the sickening</p>
		<p class="PoemLine">taste of regret from the roof of your mouth. But you don’t remember</p>
		<p class="PoemLine">much about roofs or rules ’cause since Mom’s kicked you out.</p>
		<p class="PoemLine">Since my moms kicked you out, you been out here dancing,</p>
		<p class="PoemLine">just getting by, and shit, family, all I don’t get is why.</p>
		<p class="PoemLine">Why jig to a tune that makes your mama cry? A do si do</p>
		<p class="PoemLine">for this dough, for this bread. But you don’t eat</p>
		<p class="PoemLine">just keep bobbing your head. Held up way too high</p>
		<p class="PoemLine">on your skinny unstable shoulders sits a boulder born of a rock</p>
		<p class="PoemLine">that you love to listen to. A habit to huge to fit on any compact disc.</p>
		<p class="PoemLine">But this ain’t a diss, just a soundtrack to a story I’ve heard</p>
		<p class="PoemLine">one too many times. A song from which we know</p>
		<p class="PoemLine">one too many lines. And none of ’em rhyme.</p>
		<p class="PoemLine">None of ’em make sense. Like the dollars and dreams</p>
		<p class="PoemLine">I know you have wasted. And it’s sad.</p>
		<p class="PoemLine">So fucking sad. And it always had me wondering,</p>
		<p class="PoemLine">where do crackheads learn to dance like that?</p>

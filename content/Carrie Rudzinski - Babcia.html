		<p class="PoemLine1">My grandmother is 84 when she tells me</p>
		<p class="PoemLine">she never wanted to marry my grandfather.</p>
	</div>
	<div class="PoemStanza">
		<p class="PoemLine1">I have asked enough questions to know</p>
		<p class="PoemLine">she means how could a 17 year old girl</p>
		<p class="PoemLine">marry a man she had only known a few months?</p>
	</div>
	<div class="PoemStanza">
		<p class="PoemLine1">She means he had the right passport</p>
		<p class="PoemLine">and her father said yes.</p>
	</div>
	<div class="PoemStanza">
		<p class="PoemLine1">She means she doesn’t have any teeth</p>
		<p class="PoemLine">because she lost her toothbrush so early in the war.</p>
	</div>
	<div class="PoemStanza">
		<p class="PoemLine1">My grandmother was ten</p>
		<p class="PoemLine">when her hometown of L’viv, Ukraine</p>
		<p class="PoemLine">was bombed for the first time. That day,</p>
		<p class="PoemLine">Irene took her six-year-old brother Julian</p>
		<p class="PoemLine">to get milk from the market,</p>
		<p class="PoemLine">their house on the hill, shrinking</p>
		<p class="PoemLine">behind them.</p>
	</div>
	<div class="PoemStanza">
		<p class="PoemLine1">The bombs started on the other side</p>
		<p class="PoemLine">of the city—the sky a concrete floor of fire—</p>
		<p class="PoemLine">and Irene running through the streets,</p>
		<p class="PoemLine">a giant glass jug in her arms</p>
		<p class="PoemLine">and a tiny boy clinging to her hand.</p>
	</div>
	<div class="PoemStanza">
		<p class="PoemLine1">My grandmother means</p>
		<p class="PoemLine">Julian survived a concentration camp,</p>
		<p class="PoemLine">but we do not talk about it.</p>
	</div>
	<div class="PoemStanza">
		<p class="PoemLine1">She means she worked</p>
		<p class="PoemLine">in an ammunition factory</p>
		<p class="PoemLine">Hitler had built underground.</p>
		<p class="PoemLine">Her fingers pulsing with bullets.</p>
	</div>
	<div class="PoemStanza">
		<p class="PoemLine1">She means the Nazi officers</p>
		<p class="PoemLine">fed her dog glass to kill him.</p>
	</div>
	<div class="PoemStanza">
		<p class="PoemLine1">She means when her house was bombed</p>
		<p class="PoemLine">in half, they lived in the basement</p>
		<p class="PoemLine">with pillows over the windows</p>
		<p class="PoemLine">to prevent bullets from coming inside.</p>
	</div>
	<div class="PoemStanza">
		<p class="PoemLine1">She means the men lined up in the street,</p>
		<p class="PoemLine">and every tenth one shot in the head.</p>
		<p class="PoemLine">The women shaved, naked in carts.</p>
	</div>
	<div class="PoemStanza">
		<p class="PoemLine1">Her body was so frail, the doctors</p>
		<p class="PoemLine">told her she would never have children.</p>
		<p class="PoemLine">For years, she had to be sedated</p>
		<p class="PoemLine">simply so she could sleep.</p>
	</div>
	<div class="PoemStanza">
		<p class="PoemLine1">She wanted to grow up</p>
		<p class="PoemLine">to be a physician or a scientist.</p>
		<p class="PoemLine">My grandmother did not go to high school.</p>
		<p class="PoemLine">She taught herself English</p>
		<p class="PoemLine">from reading the newspaper.</p>
		<p class="PoemLine">She met her mother-in-law</p>
		<p class="PoemLine">for the first time thirty years</p>
		<p class="PoemLine">into her marriage.</p>
	</div>
	<div class="PoemStanza">
		<p class="PoemLine1">My family has spent my entire life romanticizing</p>
		<p class="PoemLine">the way my grandfather survived World War II,</p>
		<p class="PoemLine">but it is my grandmother who is left behind.</p>
		<p class="PoemLine">She is the constant reminder of what war looks like.</p>
		<p class="PoemLine">That I am here because she survived.</p>
	</div>
	<div class="PoemStanza">
		<p class="PoemLine1">She spent decades refusing to speak of the bodies,</p>
		<p class="PoemLine">the camps—refusing to tell her daughter when</p>
		<p class="PoemLine">her wedding anniversary is—and now her mouth</p>
		<p class="PoemLine">is a nail gun. She cannot stop spilling the horror</p>
		<p class="PoemLine">from her tiny body and Ukraine</p>
		<p class="PoemLine">is still on fire.</p>
	</div>
	<div class="PoemStanza">
		<p class="PoemLine1">When my grandmother visited L’viv five years ago,</p>
		<p class="PoemLine">she was angry at the way her city</p>
		<p class="PoemLine">has never recovered—but my grandmother</p>
		<p class="PoemLine">has never recovered. They are both still choking</p>
		<p class="PoemLine">on the sound of bullets.</p>
	</div>
	<div class="PoemStanza">
		<p class="PoemLine1">My grandmother is full of holes,</p>
		<p class="PoemLine">but she loves those around her</p>
		<p class="PoemLine">as though she is forcing them</p>
		<p class="PoemLine">to rebuild, to survive.</p>
	</div>
	<div class="PoemStanza">
		<p class="PoemLine1">My grandmother is 84 when she tells me</p>
		<p class="PoemLine">she has been having the same dream for years.</p>
	</div>
	<div class="PoemStanza">
		<p class="PoemLine1">She is trapped at the bottom of a dark well</p>
		<p class="PoemLine">and her mother is standing at the top.</p>
		<p class="PoemLine">My grandmother climbs and climbs</p>
		<p class="PoemLine">and climbs the walls around her,</p>
		<p class="PoemLine">but she can never get out.</p>

	<h4><a href="dmouton-bio">Deborah “D.E.E.P.” Mouton</a></h4>
	<div class="PoemStanza">
		<p class="PoemLine1">The week my daughter’s lungs started to develop,</p>
		<p class="PoemLine">there should’ve been a giggle resonating </p>
		<p class="PoemLine">across my abdomen at the thought</p>
		<p class="PoemLine">that my baby could finally breathe on her own.</p>
	</div>
	<div class="PoemStanza">
		<p class="PoemLine1">Instead, I found myself wondering</p>
		<p class="PoemLine">how loud she would be able to scream</p>
		<p class="PoemLine">if someone touched her</p>
		<p class="PoemLine">with hands like chloroform.</p>
	</div>
	<div class="PoemStanza">
		<p class="PoemLine1">Would her voice holler like a fire engine?</p>
		<p class="PoemLine">Would her lungs hold enough air captive</p>
		<p class="PoemLine">to power her body to dash, charge her </p>
		<p class="PoemLine">vocal chords with enough electricity</p>
		<p class="PoemLine">that anyone standing in a 5 mile radius</p>
		<p class="PoemLine">would feel as though they had been</p>
		<p class="PoemLine">struck by lightning?</p>
	</div>
	<div class="PoemStanza">
		<p class="PoemLine1">At the offering of familiar candy</p>
		<p class="PoemLine">and an unfamiliar car,</p>
		<p class="PoemLine">would this daughter of mine</p>
		<p class="PoemLine">go willingly?</p>
	</div>
	<div class="PoemStanza">
		<p class="PoemLine1">Or would she be able to do</p>
		<p class="PoemLine">what her mother was unable to?</p>
	</div>
	<div class="PoemStanza">
		<p class="PoemLine1">Decipher in an inhale who to trust,</p>
		<p class="PoemLine">smell the dissolving powder </p>
		<p class="PoemLine">at the bottom of a glass of alcohol.</p>
		<p class="PoemLine">Know when their scent changed.</p>
		<p class="PoemLine">Know how to escape,</p>
		<p class="PoemLine">how to hold her breath long enough </p>
		<p class="PoemLine">to tuck and roll around the shuddering </p>
		<p class="PoemLine">shoulders of the 610 loop.</p>
	</div>
	<div class="PoemStanza">
		<p class="PoemLine1">Had I given her</p>
		<p class="PoemLine">extra gills on the inside</p>
		<p class="PoemLine">just in case someone tried</p>
		<p class="PoemLine">to drown her—tried to shove </p>
		<p class="PoemLine">her on a ship in the middle </p>
		<p class="PoemLine">of the Gulf? Could she respire</p>
		<p class="PoemLine">well enough to make it back home?</p>
	</div>
	<div class="PoemStanza">
		<p class="PoemLine1">I had already felt her fins kicking,</p>
		<p class="PoemLine">and I am saddened to report </p>
		<p class="PoemLine">that I didn’t think they were </p>
		<p class="PoemLine">strong enough.</p>
	</div>
	<div class="PoemStanza">
		<p class="PoemLine1">I don’t want her to discover </p>
		<p class="PoemLine">too quickly the dangers of being silent</p>
		<p class="PoemLine">the consequences of words caught </p>
		<p class="PoemLine">in her trachea with not enough courage to</p>
		<p class="PoemLine">push 	them 		out.</p>
	</div>
	<div class="PoemStanza">
		<p class="PoemLine1">Had I shown her how to shove </p>
		<p class="PoemLine">a banshee into the black box </p>
		<p class="PoemLine">of her throat—a siren in every sinew—</p>
		<p class="PoemLine">that at a grabbing, an inappropriate caress,</p>
		<p class="PoemLine">she could keep herself from becoming an odyssey? </p>
	</div>
	<div class="PoemStanza">
		<p class="PoemLine1">Would she be able to sustain her pitch </p>
		<p class="PoemLine">long enough to melt Odysseus’ beeswax? </p>
	</div>
	<div class="PoemStanza">
		<p class="PoemLine1">When seduction tries to convince her to come hither,</p>
		<p class="PoemLine">will she know how to flip the switch, stretch her </p>
		<p class="PoemLine">larynx into a lyre? Would she never know when to give up,</p>
		<p class="PoemLine">Steer them into a rocky demise?</p>
	</div>
	<div class="PoemStanza">
		<p class="PoemLine1">Had I shown her how to be persistent</p>
		<p class="PoemLine">when the tide rises?</p>
		<p class="PoemLine">How to load her windpipe like a shotgun</p>
		<p class="PoemLine">and buckshot when need be?</p>
	</div>
	<div class="PoemStanza">
		<p class="PoemLine1">It’s my job to teach her</p>
		<p class="PoemLine">that living on the Texas coast</p>
		<p class="PoemLine">makes her an easier commodity </p>
		<p class="PoemLine">to traffic, so I pray she is learning </p>
		<p class="PoemLine">to land lock her voice, build </p>
		<p class="PoemLine">her esophagus into a bell tower,</p>
		<p class="PoemLine">know when to ring.</p>
		<p class="PoemLine">Know when to scream.</p>
	</div>
	<div class="PoemStanza">
		<p class="PoemLine1">My job to tell her that just because </p>
		<p class="PoemLine">she is a woman, her <em>No</em>’s may sound </p>
		<p class="PoemLine">like a foreign language some people </p>
		<p class="PoemLine">may not be willing to translate.</p>
		<p class="PoemLine">But if she bellows, if she shapes </p>
		<p class="PoemLine">her duodenum into a gong,</p>
		<p class="PoemLine">swings her tongue out like a mallet</p>
		<p class="PoemLine">when they come for her,</p>
		<p class="PoemLine">she can clang some kind of </p>
		<p class="PoemLine">deafening shrill—a piercing alarm </p>
		<p class="PoemLine">tuned to her mother’s ear,</p>
	</div>
	<div class="PoemStanza">
		<p class="PoemLine1">I promise: Baby Girl,</p>
		<p class="PoemLine">I will find you</p>
	</div>
	<div class="PoemStanza">
		<p class="PoemLine1">Mommy will always</p>
		<p class="PoemLine">find you.</p>

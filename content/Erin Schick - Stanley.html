	<div class="PoemStanza">
		<p class="PoemLine1">The first time I took a life,</p>
		<p class="PoemLine">my hands were earthquakes</p>
		<p class="PoemLine">of guilt, of doubt, of fear.</p>
	</div>
	<div class="PoemStanza">
		<p class="PoemLine1">I held the knife to his throat.</p>
		<p class="PoemLine">Wonder what he saw</p>
		<p class="PoemLine">reflected in the blade.</p>
		<p class="PoemLine">I cut into his neck</p>
		<p class="PoemLine">as his eyes met mine.</p>
	</div>
	<div class="PoemStanza">
		<p class="PoemLine1">He didn’t say a word</p>
		<p class="PoemLine">as the blood began to spurt.</p>
		<p class="PoemLine">He didn’t say a word, but I know</p>
		<p class="PoemLine">what he wanted to tell me. He said,</p>
	</div>
	<div class="PoemStanza">
		<p class="PoemLine1">My name is Stanley</p>
		<p class="PoemLine">I have lived a good</p>
		<p class="PoemLine">and honorable life.</p>
	</div>
	<div class="PoemStanza">
		<p class="PoemLine1">His name was Stanley.</p>
		<p class="PoemLine">He lived a good and honorable life.</p>
		<p class="PoemLine">Woke every morning long before the sun</p>
		<p class="PoemLine">to proclaim to everyone in a five mile radius,</p>
	</div>
	<div class="PoemStanza">
		<p class="PoemLine1">Good morning!</p>
		<p class="PoemLine">My name is Stanley.</p>
		<p class="PoemLine">I am a rooster!</p>
		<p class="PoemLine">My name is Stanley.</p>
		<p class="PoemLine">I am a good and honorable rooster!</p>
		<p class="PoemLine">Good morning!</p>
	</div>
	<div class="PoemStanza">
		<p class="PoemLine1">Unlike most roosters, who hatch</p>
		<p class="PoemLine">from their shells screaming,</p>
		<p class="PoemLine">Hey there motherfuckers!</p>
		<p class="PoemLine">I’m a motherfucking rooster!</p>
		<p class="PoemLine">Stanley spent the majority of his life</p>
		<p class="PoemLine">thinking he was a hen.</p>
		<p class="PoemLine">I can’t say I blame him.</p>
		<p class="PoemLine">He wanted to be one of the girls.</p>
		<p class="PoemLine">He wanted to fit in.</p>
	</div>
	<div class="PoemStanza">
		<p class="PoemLine1">Until one day, something changed.</p>
		<p class="PoemLine">There were feathers where previously </p>
		<p class="PoemLine">there had not been feathers, like he</p>
		<p class="PoemLine">was suddenly reminded of his position</p>
		<p class="PoemLine">of privilege in the poultry patriarchy,</p>
		<p class="PoemLine">turned to the hens as if to say,</p>
	</div>
	<div class="PoemStanza">
		<p class="PoemLine1">Goddamn!</p>
		<p class="PoemLine">I’m a rooster!</p>
		<p class="PoemLine">Did you know that I’m a rooster?</p>
		<p class="PoemLine">Goddamn!</p>
		<p class="PoemLine">My name is Stanley and I am a rooster!</p>
	</div>
	<div class="PoemStanza">
		<p class="PoemLine1">And what a rooster he was.</p>
		<p class="PoemLine">He took on his new job with such pride,</p>
		<p class="PoemLine">gathering grass and grain to distribute</p>
		<p class="PoemLine">amongst the hens in their nest boxes,</p>
		<p class="PoemLine">quelling domestic disputes</p>
		<p class="PoemLine">taking up a daily guard post</p>
		<p class="PoemLine">of constant vigilance to protect the flock.</p>
	</div>
	<div class="PoemStanza">
		<p class="PoemLine1">He tried to protect the flock</p>
		<p class="PoemLine">the day the neighbor’s dogs attacked.</p>
		<p class="PoemLine">He was a whirling dervish of green</p>
		<p class="PoemLine">and crimson feathers, sounding the shrill alarm,</p>
		<p class="PoemLine">drawing attention to himself for as long as possible</p>
		<p class="PoemLine">to let others escape to safety.</p>
	</div>
	<div class="PoemStanza">
		<p class="PoemLine1">The dogs were called off seconds before capturing Stanley.</p>
		<p class="PoemLine">For two days I carried him to and from the henhouse,</p>
		<p class="PoemLine">fed him by hand, cleaned his crusting wounds.</p>
	</div>
	<div class="PoemStanza">
		<p class="PoemLine1">When it became clear Stanley</p>
		<p class="PoemLine">would not recover, it was up to me</p>
		<p class="PoemLine">to kill him. Me, the 16 year-old farm-sitter</p>
		<p class="PoemLine">in rain boots and a sweat stained t-shirt.</p>
		<p class="PoemLine">Me, pulling the slaughter knife from the cabinet</p>
		<p class="PoemLine">where it was kept out of reach of children</p>
		<p class="PoemLine">like me. Considered more than briefly testing</p>
		<p class="PoemLine">its strength against the softness of my own skin.</p>
		<p class="PoemLine">Wondered out loud if I might survive the slaughter.</p>
	</div>
	<div class="PoemStanza">
		<p class="PoemLine1">I cut off his head,</p>
		<p class="PoemLine">buried his carcass</p>
		<p class="PoemLine">in a black plastic bag.</p>
		<p class="PoemLine">I killed him.</p>
		<p class="PoemLine">Stanley, the good</p>
		<p class="PoemLine">and honorable rooster.</p>
	</div>
	<div class="PoemStanza">
		<p class="PoemLine1">I wonder,</p>
		<p class="PoemLine">Who will it be to hold that knife to my throat?</p>
		<p class="PoemLine">What will I see reflected in the blade?</p>
		<p class="PoemLine">Will it ever be more than relief?</p>
	</div>
	<div class="PoemStanza">
		<p class="PoemLine1">One of these days,</p>
		<p class="PoemLine">I will stand before god.</p>
		<p class="PoemLine">What will I tell her</p>
		<p class="PoemLine">when she finally admits</p>
		<p class="PoemLine">I was meant to be a man</p>
		<p class="PoemLine">(but when she learned</p>
		<p class="PoemLine">I was born to climb mountains,</p>
		<p class="PoemLine">she knew the women needed me more)?</p>
		<p class="PoemLine">When I stand before her</p>
		<p class="PoemLine">with Stanley on my shoulder,</p>
		<p class="PoemLine">will he tell me I set him free </p>
		<p class="PoemLine">to follow his flock to heaven?</p>
		<p class="PoemLine">Is he now the rooster in the henhouse of god?</p>
	</div>
	<div class="PoemStanza">
		<p class="PoemLine1">When I stand before her,</p>
		<p class="PoemLine">will I be a woman?</p>
		<p class="PoemLine">Will I be a man?</p>
		<p class="PoemLine">Will I finally belong?</p>
		<p class="PoemLine">Will I ever be able to tell her,</p>
		<p class="PoemLine"><em>My name is Erin.</em></p>
		<p class="PoemLine"><em>I have lived a good and honorable life</em></p>

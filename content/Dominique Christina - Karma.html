      <p class="PoemLine">pickled by the sun. They line streets </p>
      <p class="PoemLine">in countries we never think about. </p>
      <p class="PoemLine">And we suck our teeth and ask a thesaurus </p>

      <p class="PoemLine">to pregnant bellies, sterilizations, inoculations,</p>
      <p class="PoemLine">leg irons and chains. The bit, the noose.</p>

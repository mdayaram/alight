	<h4><a href="mmay-bio">Melissa May</a></h4>
	<div class="PoemStanza">
		<p class="PoemLine1">All the dude said, </p>
		<p class="PoemLine">arm cocked over the back of his chair, </p>
		<p class="PoemLine">leaning into the tittering ear of his friend was:</p>
		<p class="PoemLine"><em>Great&hellip;Another Woman Poem.</em></p>
	</div>
	<div class="PoemStanza">
		<p class="PoemLine1">That&rsquo;s all he said. My hand to God.</p>
	</div>
	<div class="PoemStanza">
		<p class="PoemLine1">But my cunt growled ferocious </p>
		<p class="PoemLine">over her straw-broken back, burst through </p>
		<p class="PoemLine">her sensible and clean cotton cocoon&mdash;</p>
		<p class="PoemLine">swelling clit flopping out of the folds like</p>
		<p class="PoemLine">the tongue of a timber wolf, rabid.</p>
	</div>
	<div class="PoemStanza">
		<p class="PoemLine1">My vagina did the Grinch&rsquo;s heart</p>
		<p class="PoemLine">a thousand times better. Inflated,</p>
		<p class="PoemLine">first to the size of a watermelon,</p>
		<p class="PoemLine">knocking the microphone clean</p>
		<p class="PoemLine">off the stage, then elongated â€“ </p>
		<p class="PoemLine">LIKE.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;COCK!</p>
		<p class="PoemLine">Because she&rsquo;s&nbsp;&nbsp;<em>a&nbsp;l&nbsp;w&nbsp;a&nbsp;y&nbsp;s</em>&nbsp;&nbsp; wanted </p>
		<p class="PoemLine">to be a cock! Though in the newspaper </p>
		<p class="PoemLine">the next day, she looked more like a giant </p>
		<p class="PoemLine">butternut squash, an innocent swollen </p>
		<p class="PoemLine">gourd that promptly crushed the host </p>
		<p class="PoemLine">and half of the screaming crowd to death</p>
		<p class="PoemLine">as they queued up at the back door </p>
		<p class="PoemLine">trying to escape.</p>
	</div>
	<div class="PoemStanza">
		<p class="PoemLine1">When her mouth finally opened, </p>
		<p class="PoemLine">she was the size of a hot air balloon.</p>
		<p class="PoemLine">The rest of my body flailing around </p>
		<p class="PoemLine">behind her like a rag-doll glued</p>
		<p class="PoemLine">to a Goodyear Blimp by the crotch.</p>
		<p class="PoemLine">And like a douche-seeking missile,</p>
		<p class="PoemLine">she locked in on the slithering throat </p>
		<p class="PoemLine">of the man who woke her from her slumber,</p>
		<p class="PoemLine">spread her lips like the wings of a giant pink bat</p>
		<p class="PoemLine">and swallowed that motherfucker <em>whole</em>.</p>
		<p class="PoemLine">Didn&rsquo;t even bother to chew.</p>
	</div>
	<div class="PoemStanza">
		<p class="PoemLine1">But&hellip;she had teeth.</p>
		<p class="PoemLine">Sharp, drooling things, </p>
		<p class="PoemLine">all of them studded in gold </p>
		<p class="PoemLine">with the words <em>NO</em></p>
		<p class="PoemLine"><em>IS A COMPLETE SENTENCE</em></p>
	</div>
	<div class="PoemStanza">
		<p class="PoemLine1">When she was roughly the size </p>
		<p class="PoemLine">of a downtown building, she had swallowed </p>
		<p class="PoemLine">the venue, three city blocks, a Dr. Pepper 10 billboard,</p>
		<p class="PoemLine">and 4 transit buses chock FULL of men telling her</p>
		<p class="PoemLine">how pretty she&rsquo;d be if she would just smile.</p>
		<p class="PoemLine"><em>So she Smiled&#8230;</em></p>
	</div>
	<div class="PoemStanza">
		<p class="PoemLine1">And they stopped smiling.</p>
	</div>
	<div class="PoemStanza">
		<p class="PoemLine1">There were swat teams and zookeepers </p>
		<p class="PoemLine">and National Guardsmen letting loose </p>
		<p class="PoemLine">a torrent of bullets and tranquilizer darts.</p>
		<p class="PoemLine">Snipers set up on rooftops as she emptied</p>
		<p class="PoemLine">entire strip clubs into her mouth like miniature </p>
		<p class="PoemLine">boxes of sweet and tangy Halloween candy, </p>
		<p class="PoemLine">stopping only to floss between her consent-chops </p>
		<p class="PoemLine">with their gleaming silver poles.</p>
	</div>
	<div class="PoemStanza">
		<p class="PoemLine1">Hulked out and Twat-Smashing helicopters like tiny toy planes</p>
		<p class="PoemLine">(TWAT ANGRY! TWAT SMAAAAAAAAAASH),</p>
		<p class="PoemLine">she threw back her head and laughed the deep</p>
		<p class="PoemLine">and ancient laugh of a beast man cannot kill</p>
		<p class="PoemLine"><em>because man has not taken the time to understand.</em></p>
	</div>
	<div class="PoemStanza">
		<p class="PoemLine1">And when she finally, finally felt like her point </p>
		<p class="PoemLine">had been made, she shrank quietly back down </p>
		<p class="PoemLine">beneath my skirt and purred like the gentle </p>
		<p class="PoemLine">and beautiful and VALID thing </p>
		<p class="PoemLine">that she always has been.</p>
	</div>
	<div class="PoemStanza">
		<p class="PoemLine1">So if you were thinking, and I mean, even THINKING</p>
		<p class="PoemLine">about rolling your eyes at <em>just another woman poem</em>,</p>
		<p class="PoemLine">I&rsquo;d really take a second to reconsider, broseph.</p>
	</div>
	<div class="PoemStanza">
		<p class="PoemLine1">Because sometimes</p>
		<p class="PoemLine">my vagina</p>
		<p class="PoemLine">gets angry.</p>
	</div>
	<div class="PoemStanza">
		<p class="PoemLine1">And BELIEVE ME,</p>
		<p class="PoemLine">you will not like her</p>
		<p class="PoemLine">that way.</p>

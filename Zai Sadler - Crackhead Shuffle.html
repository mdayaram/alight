	<div class="PoemStanza">
		<p class="PoemLine1">So there&rsquo;s this new dance. Its called the crackhead shuffle</p>
		<p class="PoemLine">A not so subtle, not so simple dance with one step: Move,</p>
		<p class="PoemLine">move to the best block, move to yo&rsquo; next rock. Rock and</p>
		<p class="PoemLine">nod a bob, but can&rsquo;t stop, won&rsquo;t stop, like the Roc</p>
		<p class="PoemLine">but the only thing that rocks this fella is a hella fire</p>
		<p class="PoemLine">internal beat, that won&rsquo;t let his hella tired feet cease from</p>
		<p class="PoemLine">singeing sorry streets soured with smoke and shame</p>
		<p class="PoemLine">lames who let the game play them. Those who probably</p>
		<p class="PoemLine">let the 80&rsquo;s pay them. And now they&rsquo;re paying for it</p>
		<p class="PoemLine">Mama said, &ldquo;Everybody&rsquo;s got a dancer in the family right?&rdquo;</p>
		<p class="PoemLine">One that can two step around twelve. Who tap dances in shoes</p>
		<p class="PoemLine">he only intends to sell, but he digs blues. And jazz,</p>
		<p class="PoemLine">and rap, and rock. Yeah, nothin&rsquo;s like rocks.</p>
		<p class="PoemLine">That shit will knock your socks off. Like great sex.</p>
		<p class="PoemLine">Like cheap latex. It can bust and break and birth</p>
		<p class="PoemLine">new generations stuck singing the same song. On the same</p>
		<p class="PoemLine">station. Searching for a rhythm that resembles that first fist fight</p>
		<p class="PoemLine">with your father. That first time you ignored brother and stole</p>
		<p class="PoemLine">from mother. That first fix was was supposed to fix all that.</p>
		<p class="PoemLine">Did it? Did it?</p>
		<p class="PoemLine">Now you&rsquo;re stuck shuffling your two left feet</p>
		<p class="PoemLine">searching for a dream of a life thats just in your reach</p>
		<p class="PoemLine">like toothbrushes and toothpaste. Trying to scrape the sickening</p>
		<p class="PoemLine">taste of regret from the roof of your mouth. But you don&rsquo;t remember</p>
		<p class="PoemLine">much about roofs or rules &rsquo;cause since Mom&rsquo;s kicked you out.</p>
		<p class="PoemLine">Since my moms kicked you out, you been out here dancing,</p>
		<p class="PoemLine">just getting by, and shit, family, all I don&rsquo;t get is why.</p>
		<p class="PoemLine">Why jig to a tune that makes your mama cry? A do si do</p>
		<p class="PoemLine">for this dough, for this bread. But you don&rsquo;t eat</p>
		<p class="PoemLine">just keep bobbing your head. Held up way too high</p>
		<p class="PoemLine">on your skinny unstable shoulders sits a boulder born of a rock</p>
		<p class="PoemLine">that you love to listen to. A habit to huge to fit on any compact disc.</p>
		<p class="PoemLine">But this ain&rsquo;t a diss, just a soundtrack to a story I&rsquo;ve heard</p>
		<p class="PoemLine">one too many times. A song from which we know</p>
		<p class="PoemLine">one too many lines. And none of &rsquo;em rhyme.</p>
		<p class="PoemLine">None of &rsquo;em make sense. Like the dollars and dreams</p>
		<p class="PoemLine">I know you have wasted. And it&rsquo;s sad.</p>
		<p class="PoemLine">So fucking sad. And it always had me wondering,</p>
		<p class="PoemLine">where do crackheads learn to dance like that?</p>

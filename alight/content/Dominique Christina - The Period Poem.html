    <div class="PoemStanza">
      <p class="PoemLine1">Dude on Twitter says: </p>
      <p class="PoemLine"><em>I was having sex with my girl</em> </p>
      <p class="PoemLine"><em>when she started her period</em>. </p>
      <p class="PoemLine"><em>I dumped that bitch immediately</em>.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="PoemStanza">
      <p class="PoemLine1">Dear nameless Dummy on Twitter,</p>
      <p class="PoemLine">You’re the reason my daughter </p>
      <p class="PoemLine">cried funeral tears when she started </p>
      <p class="PoemLine">HER period, the sudden grief </p>
      <p class="PoemLine">all young girls feel after the matriculation </p>
      <p class="PoemLine">from childhood and the induction into a reality </p>
      <p class="PoemLine">that includes negotiating people like you </p>
      <p class="PoemLine">and your disdain for what a woman’s body </p>
      <p class="PoemLine">can do. Here begins an anatomy lesson </p>
      <p class="PoemLine">infused with feminist politics because</p>
      <p class="PoemLine">I HATE you. </p>
    </div>
    <div class="PoemStanza">
      <p class="PoemLine1">There is a thing called a uterus. </p>
      <p class="PoemLine">It sheds itself every 28 days or so </p>
      <p class="PoemLine">(in my case every 23 days.</p>
      <p class="PoemLine">I have always been a rule breaker. </p>
      <p class="PoemLine">I digress.). That’s the anatomy part. </p>
    </div>
    <div class="PoemStanza">
      <p class="PoemLine1">The feminist politic part is </p>
      <p class="PoemLine">that women know how </p>
      <p class="PoemLine">to let things go. </p>
      <p class="PoemLine">How to let a dying thing </p>
      <p class="PoemLine">leave the body. How to regenerate.</p>
      <p class="PoemLine">How to become a new thing, </p>
      <p class="PoemLine">just waxing and waning </p>
      <p class="PoemLine">no different than the moon </p>
      <p class="PoemLine">and the tides, both of which influence </p>
      <p class="PoemLine">how YOU behave. I digress. </p>
    </div>
    <div class="PoemStanza">
      <p class="PoemLine1">Women have vaginas that can speak to each other.</p>
      <p class="PoemLine">By this I mean when we are with our friends, our sisters,  </p>
      <p class="PoemLine">Our menstrual cycles will actually sync UP. </p>
      <p class="PoemLine">My own vagina is mad influential. </p>
      <p class="PoemLine">EVERYBODY I love knows </p>
      <p class="PoemLine">how to bleed with me. </p>
      <p class="PoemLine">Hold onto that. There’s a metaphor in it. </p>
    </div>
    <div class="PoemStanza">
      <p class="PoemLine1">But when YOUR mama carried YOU,</p>
      <p class="PoemLine">the ocean in her belly was </p>
      <p class="PoemLine">what made you buoyant,</p>
      <p class="PoemLine">made you possible. </p>
    </div>
    <div class="PoemStanza">
      <p class="PoemLine1">You had it under your tongue </p>
      <p class="PoemLine">when you burst through her skin wet </p>
      <p class="PoemLine">and panting from the heat of her body.</p>
      <p class="PoemLine">The body whose machinery </p>
      <p class="PoemLine">you now mock on social media, </p>
      <p class="PoemLine">THAT body wrapped you </p>
      <p class="PoemLine">in everything that was miraculous about it </p>
      <p class="PoemLine">and sung you lullabies laced in platelets, </p>
      <p class="PoemLine">without which you wouldn’t have </p>
      <p class="PoemLine">no Twitter account at all, motherfucker. </p>
      <p class="PoemLine">I digress. </p>
    </div>
    <div class="PoemStanza">
      <p class="PoemLine1">See, women know the world better </p>
      <p class="PoemLine">because of the blood that visits us. </p>
      <p class="PoemLine">It interrupts our favorite white skirts </p>
      <p class="PoemLine">and shows up at dinner parties uninvited. </p>
      <p class="PoemLine">Blood will do that. </p>
      <p class="PoemLine">Period. </p>
      <p class="PoemLine">It will come when you are not prepared for it. </p>
      <p class="PoemLine">Blood does that.  </p>
      <p class="PoemLine">Period. </p>
      <p class="PoemLine">Blood is the biggest siren.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="PoemStanza">
      <p class="PoemLine1">Women understand that blood misbehaves. Period. </p>
      <p class="PoemLine">It does not wait for a hand signal </p>
      <p class="PoemLine">or a welcome sign above the door. </p>
    </div>
    <div class="PoemStanza">
      <p class="PoemLine1">And when you deal in blood,</p>
      <p class="PoemLine">over and over again like we do,</p>
      <p class="PoemLine">when it keeps returning to you…</p>
      <p class="PoemLine">Well, that makes you a warrior. </p>
      <p class="PoemLine">And while all good generals </p>
      <p class="PoemLine">know NOT to discuss battle plans </p>
      <p class="PoemLine">with the enemy, </p>
      <p class="PoemLine">let me say this, Dummy on Twitter:</p>
    </div>
    <div class="PoemStanza">
      <p class="PoemLine1">If there is any balance in the universe at all, </p>
      <p class="PoemLine">you will be blessed with daughters. </p>
      <p class="PoemLine">Blessed.</p>
      <p class="PoemLine"> </p>
      <p class="PoemLine">Etymologically, ‘bless’ means <em>to make bleed</em>. </p>
      <p class="PoemLine">See, now it’s a lesson in linguistics. </p>
      <p class="PoemLine">In other words, </p>
      <p class="PoemLine">Blood SPEAKS. That’s the message. </p>
      <p class="PoemLine">Stay with me. </p>
    </div>
    <div class="PoemStanza">
      <p class="PoemLine1">I pray your daughters </p>
      <p class="PoemLine">teach you what all men </p>
      <p class="PoemLine">must one day come to know: </p>
      <p class="PoemLine">That women, made of moonlight, </p>
      <p class="PoemLine">magic, and macabre, will make you </p>
      <p class="PoemLine">know the blood. Will get it all over </p>
      <p class="PoemLine">the sheets and car seats. Women. </p>
      <p class="PoemLine">Will introduce you to their insides. </p>
      <p class="PoemLine">Period. </p>
      <p class="PoemLine">And if you are as unprepared</p>
      <p class="PoemLine">as we sometimes are…</p>
      <p class="PoemLine">It will get all over you</p>
      <p class="PoemLine">and leave a forever stain. </p>
      <p class="PoemLine">Period. </p>
    </div>
    <div class="PoemStanza">
      <p class="PoemLine1">So, to my daughter:</p>
      <p class="PoemLine">Should anybody be fool enough </p>
      <p class="PoemLine">to mishandle the wild geography </p>
      <p class="PoemLine">of your body, how it rides </p>
      <p class="PoemLine">a red running current </p>
      <p class="PoemLine">like any good wolf or witch…</p>
      <p class="PoemLine">Well then bleed, baby. </p>
      <p class="PoemLine">Give that blood a biblical name,</p>
      <p class="PoemLine">something made of stone and mortar.</p>
      <p class="PoemLine">Give it a name he can’t pronounce.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="PoemStanza">
      <p class="PoemLine1">Name it for Eve’s first rebellion</p>
      <p class="PoemLine">in that garden.</p>

    <div class="PoemStanza">
      <p class="PoemLine1">Name it after the last little girl </p>
      <p class="PoemLine">to have her genitals mutilated </p>
      <p class="PoemLine">in Kinshasa—that was this morning.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="PoemStanza">
      <p class="PoemLine1">Give it as many syllables as </p>
      <p class="PoemLine">there are unreported rape cases.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="PoemStanza">
      <p class="PoemLine1">Name the blood something mighty,</p>
      <p class="PoemLine">something unlanguageable </p>
      <p class="PoemLine">something in hieroglyphs, </p>
      <p class="PoemLine">something that sounds like </p>
      <p class="PoemLine">the end of the world.</p>
      <p class="PoemLine">Something with crooked teeth </p>
      <p class="PoemLine">and two fat fists. </p>
    </div>
    <div class="PoemStanza">
      <p class="PoemLine1">Name it what your great great grandmother </p>
      <p class="PoemLine">called herself before those ships came</p>
      <p class="PoemLine">and left her loveless.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="PoemStanza">
      <p class="PoemLine1">Name it for the roar </p>
      <p class="PoemLine">between your legs, </p>

      <p class="PoemLine">who will NOT be nameless here. </p>
      <p class="PoemLine">Just bleed anyhow. </p>
      <p class="PoemLine">Spill your impossible scripture </p>
      <p class="PoemLine">all over the good furniture. </p>
      <p class="PoemLine">Just bleed…on everything…</p>

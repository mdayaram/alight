  <p class="ProseStanza offset-s">
    <em>Mz Ebony,<br>
        If you don’t have a condom can you use a plastic bag?</em>
  </p>
  <p class="ProseStanza offset-s">
    No. Plastic bags won’t protect you from STD’s or prevent pregnancy.
  </p>
  <p class="ProseStanza offset-s">
    <em>Mz Ebony,<br>
        Can a girl get pregnant if I put my Peter in her ear?</em>
  </p>
  <p class="ProseStanza offset-s">
    No. That was an episode from Family Guy; not real life. Also, in this class, we will only use medically correct terms.
  </p>
  <p class="ProseStanza offset-s">
    <em>Mz Ebony,<br>
        What’s another word for balls?</em>
  </p>
  <p class="ProseStanza offset-s">
    Testicles.
  </p>
  <p class="ProseStanza offset-s">
    <em>Mz Ebony,<br>
        Why do girls scream when they have sex and what if the bed breaks?</em>
  </p>
  <p class="ProseStanza offset-s">
    Women and men make noises during sex as a pleasurable response, in most cases.  This is normal and okay.<br>
    If the bed is not sturdy, then it could break, but hopefully no one gets hurt.
  </p>
  <p class="PoemLine">I am trained to answer these questions.</p>
  <p class="PoemLine">But sometimes I wanna say:</p>
  <p class="ProseStanza offset-s">
    If there is a girl that will allow you to put a plastic bag inside her, this is not the girl for you. <br>
    Ejaculating into someone… anyone’s ear is gross and confusing, because WHY WOULD YOU WANT TO DO THAT!?!<br>
    You could say nuts, tea bags, sac, beans, boys, friends… but who the hell is Peter!??<br>
    And all women don’t scream, because not all of us need to. The question you should be more concerned with is “How will I know if she’s faking or not?”  <br>
    But none of the above has to do with the bed breaking!<br>
  </p>
  <p class="PoemLine">But then there are questions put into the box</p>
  <p class="PoemLine">with Tim’s name attached as true as the Sun </p>
  <p class="PoemLine">admits it’s a star, with print as small </p>
  <p class="PoemLine">as the signature of a gnat. Evenly folded </p>
  <p class="PoemLine">to show me how careful I have to be </p>
  <p class="PoemLine">in answering his questions:</p>
  <div class="PoemStanza offset-s">
    <p class="PoemLine offset-s"><em>Mz Ebony</em>,</p>
    <p class="PoemLine offset-s"><em>Why does liking the color pink make me gay?</em></p>
    <p class="PoemLine offset-s"><em>And if I am is it bad</em>?</p>
  </div>
  <div class="PoemStanza">
    <p class="PoemLine1">And I immediately wanted to show him </p>
    <p class="PoemLine">how to be camouflaged; how to give up </p>
    <p class="PoemLine">his shadow and become a closet;</p>
    <p class="PoemLine">that they have picket signs and slanderous </p>
    <p class="PoemLine">tongues shaped like swords of malice made </p>
    <p class="PoemLine">for cutting; that we all have a certain type </p>
    <p class="PoemLine">of prejudiced bully inside us… </p>
  </div>
  <div class="PoemStanza">
    <p class="PoemLine">You boy, must not believe in being out-casted.</p>
    <p class="PoemLine">And that blue, blue is more fitting </p>
    <p class="PoemLine">for the sinking emotions you might feel,</p>
    <p class="PoemLine">or to show the life span of your bruises </p>
    <p class="PoemLine">that haven’t quite healed yet, or the color </p>
    <p class="PoemLine">of your iris before a piece of you turned grey. </p>
  </div>
  <div class="PoemStanza">
    <p class="PoemLine">Tim, with all of his 206 bones, </p>
    <p class="PoemLine">17 of them reaching for me in his eyes, </p>
    <p class="PoemLine">looks at me the way he does hope </p>
    <p class="PoemLine">and the ability to love outside of himself, </p>
    <p class="PoemLine">is waiting for an answer.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="PoemStanza offset-s">
    <p class="PoemLine">So, I say, You can be a pink Spider Man </p>
    <p class="PoemLine">if you want to, a bow tie,</p>
    <p class="PoemLine">a cupcake with pink insides, </p>
    <p class="PoemLine">just as long as you’re a heartbeat.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="PoemStanza offset-s">
    <p class="PoemLine1 ">Preference and colors are attached to emotions, </p>
    <p class="PoemLine ">so you should do what feels good.  </p>
    <p class="PoemLine ">You gotta be willing to be brave enough </p>
    <p class="PoemLine ">to be the only one who knows you’re afraid.</p>
    <p class="PoemLine ">Bad is hiding inside yourself.</p>
    <p class="PoemLine ">Bad is someone judging you by what they don’t understand </p>
    <p class="PoemLine ">or in which direction your heart goes, when love is supposed to be </p>
    <p class="PoemLine ">a good thing that you shouldn’t have to control, or use </p>
    <p class="PoemLine ">a cookie cutter to recreate; that love can be a person, place, or thing </p>
    <p class="PoemLine ">and any action you can wrap around that special person </p>
    <p class="PoemLine ">that makes your heart explode when they walk into a room.</p>

  <div class="PoemStanza offset-s">
    <p class="PoemLine1">There is no skull and crossbones over your heart. </p>
    <p class="PoemLine">You are a good thing that someone will be dying to get next to.  </p>
